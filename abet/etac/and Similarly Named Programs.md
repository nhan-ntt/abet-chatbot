These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
manufacturing or similar modifiers in their titles. An accreditable degree program in
manufacturing engineering technology will provide graduates with instruction in
technical and leadership skills necessary for manufacturing competitiveness and to
enter careers in manufacturing process and systems design, operations, quality,
continuous improvement, lean manufacturing, and sustainability. The Llevel and scope
of career preparation will depend on the degree level and specific program orientation
as portrayed by its program’s educational objectives.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in traditional and
advanced manufacturing engineering technologyies. Graduates typically enter the
professions in manufacturing operations and service functions or are prepared for
transfer to a baccalaureate degree program, as appropriate to the program’s educational
objectives. The curriculum must include instruction in the following topics:

```
a. materials and manufacturing processes, both traditional and advanced;
b. the product design process, tooling, and assembly;
c. manufacturing systems, digital enterprise tools, automation, controls, and
operations; and
d. statistics, quality and continuous improvement, and industrial organization and
management.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in traditional and
advanced manufacturing engineering technologyies. Baccalaureate degree graduates
build on the strengths of associate degree programs by gaining the knowledge, skills,
and abilities for entry into manufacturing careers by practicing various tools,
techniques and processes. The depth and breadth of expertise demonstrated by
baccalaureate graduates must support the program’s educational objectives. The
curriculum must include instruction in the following topics:

```
a. materials and manufacturing processes, both traditional and advanced;
b. the product design process, tooling, and assembly;
c. manufacturing systems, digital enterprise tools, automation, controls, and
operations;
```

```
d. statistics, quality and continuous improvement, and industrial organization and
management; and
e. manufacturing laboratory or facility experience: measurement of manufacturing
process input variables, analysis of output responses, and development of
technical inferences about the process; and
f. capstone or integrating experience that develops and illustrates student
competencies in applying both written and oral communication skills while using
technical and non-technical skills in successfully solving manufacturing
problems.
```
Faculty

The program must demonstrate that faculty members maintain currency in
manufacturing engineering technology practice.
