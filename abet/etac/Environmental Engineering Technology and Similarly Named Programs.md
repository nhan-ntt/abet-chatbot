These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
environmental or similar modifiers in their titles. An accreditable program in
environmental engineering technology will prepare graduates with the technical and
managerial skills necessary to enter careers in design, operation, and maintenance in
the field of environmental engineering technology.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduate with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in environmental
engineering technology. Graduates of associate degree programs have strengths in
operation and maintenance of facilities for monitoring or treatment of wastes and
environmental contamination or conducting assessment of environmental
contamination, including environmental sampling and laboratory analysis. The
following curriculum topics are required:

```
a. Field and laboratory measurements of environmental parameters, including use
of common instruments and equipment appropriate to environmental engineering
technology;
b. Preparation of documents such as permit applications or reports to describe
results of environmental sampling and measurement;
c. Quality control methods in sampling and measurement and utilizing basic
statistical techniques in analysis of the results;
d. Concepts of professional practice and application of project management;
e. Roles and responsibilities of public and private organizations pertaining to
environmental regulations, including applicable standards, reporting
requirements and other permitting requirements; and
f. Operating principles of commonly used unit processes for environmental
protection.

**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in environmental
engineering technology. Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs have strengths in
their knowledge of design of sampling plans, and design, operation, and management of


treatment facilities or remediation operations. The following curriculum topics are
required:

```
a. Field and laboratory measurements of environmental parameters, including use
of common instruments and equipment appropriate to environmental engineering
technology;
b. Preparation of documents such as permit applications or reports to describe
results of environmental sampling and measurement;
c. Quality control methods in sampling and measurement and utilizing basic
statistical techniques in analysis of the results;
d. Concepts of professional practice and application of project management;
e. Roles and responsibilities of public and private organizations pertaining to
environmental regulations, including applicable standards, reporting
requirements and other permitting requirements;
f. Operating principles of commonly used unit processes for environmental
protection;
g. Application of probability and statistics to measured data and performing risk
analyses;
h. Formulation of material balances;
i. Application of basic environmental science principles; and
j. Design of unit processes commonly used for environmental protection.

Faculty

The program must demonstrate that a majority of faculty members teaching courses
that are primarily design in content are qualified to teach the subject matter by virtue
of professional licensure, board certification in environmental engineering, or by
education and design experience.
