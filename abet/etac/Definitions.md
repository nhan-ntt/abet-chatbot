### Definitions

While ABET recognizes and supports the prerogative of institutions to adopt and use
the terminology of their choice, it is necessary for ABET volunteers and staff to have a
consistent understanding of terminology. With that purpose in mind, the Commissions
will use the following basic definitions:

**Program Educational Objectives**

```
Program educational objectives are broad statements that describe what
graduates are expected to attain within a few years after graduation. Program
educational objectives are based on the needs of the programâ€™s constituencies.
```
**Student Outcomes**

```
Student outcomes describe what students are expected to know and be able to
do by the time of graduation. These relate to the knowledge, skills, and
behaviors that students acquire as they progress through the program.
```
**Assessment**

```
Assessment is one or more processes that identify, collect, and prepare data to
evaluate the attainment of student outcomes. Effective assessment uses
relevant direct, indirect, quantitative and qualitative measures as appropriate
to the outcome being measured. Appropriate sampling methods may be used as
part of an assessment process.
```
**Evaluation**

```
Evaluation is one or more processes for interpreting the data and evidence
accumulated through assessment processes. Evaluation determines the extent
to which student outcomes are being attained. Evaluation results in decisions
and actions regarding program improvement.
```
**Respectful Environment**

```
A respectful environment supports, values, and treats all members fairly and
with dignity.
```

The Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of ABET recognizes that
its constituents may consider certain terms to have certain meanings; however, it is
necessary for the ETAC to have consistent terminology. Thus the ETAC will use the
following definition in applying the criteria.

**Natural Science**

```
Increases the knowledge base of a field of research and science collectively that
are involved in the study of the physical world and its phenomena. Natural
science consists of but is not limited to biology, physics, chemistry, geology
and other natural sciences including life, earth and space sciences.
```
The criteria for accreditation are in two sections.

**General Criteria**

```
General Criteria apply to all programs accredited by an ABET commission.
Each program accredited by an ABET commission must satisfy every Criterion
that is in the General Criteria for that commission.
```
**Program Criteria**

```
The Program Criteria provide discipline-specific accreditation criteria.
Programs must show that they satisfy all of the specific Program Criteria
implied by the program title. Any overlapping requirements need be satisfied
only once.
```
It is the responsibility of the program seeking accreditation to demonstrate clearly that
the program meets the following criteria.
