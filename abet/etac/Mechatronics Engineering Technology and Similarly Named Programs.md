### Mechatronics Engineering Technology and Similarly Named Programs

```
Lead Societies: ASME, IEEE, SME
```
These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
mechatronics, or similar modifiers in their titles. An accreditable program prepares
graduates, through specialized curriculum, with the necessary knowledge and skills to
meet the needs of the constituents that they serve.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must prepare associate degree graduates with the skills necessary to
enter careers in the associated industries such as robotics, automotive, advanced
manufacturing, and automation. Through the inclusion of specialized curricula,
graduates of associate degree programs typically have strengths in applying their
knowledge to the occupational areas of: building, testing, installing, documenting,
operating, or maintaining basic mechatronics systems. Given the breadth of technical
expertise involved with knowledge and use of modern equipment in mechatronics
engineering technology, and the unique objectives of individual programs, some
associate degree programs may focus on preparing graduates with in-depth but narrow
expertise, while other programs may choose to prepare graduates with expertise in a
broad spectrum of the field. Therefore, the depth and breadth of expertise demonstrated
by associate degree graduates must be appropriate to support the educational
objectives of the program. The following curricular areas are required:

```
a. Mechatronics component and system application; tooling and assembly (with
respect to electrical components and circuits (digital and analog); embedded
systems and control; pneumatic, hydraulic, industrial controls; automation and
PLCs);
b. Mechatronics systems software analysis tools; connectivity, industrial
communication protocols and information security;
c. Quality and continuous improvement techniques;
d. Selection, set-up, and calibration of measurement tools, instrumentation and
sensors;
e. Preparation of laboratory reports and systems integration, drawings associated
with development, installation, or maintenance of mechatronics components and
systems;
f. Troubleshooting of mechatronics system including maintenance or repair; and
g. An integrating experience or capstone project that illustrates student
competencies in applying both technical and non-technical skills in successfully
solving industrial mechatronics problems.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must prepare baccalaureate degree graduates with skills necessary to
enter careers in the associated industries such as robotics, automotive, advanced


manufacturing, and automation. Through the inclusion of specialized curricula,
graduates of baccalaureate degree programs are prepared to apply their knowledge in
the occupational areas of: specifying, designing, building, testing, installing,
documenting, operating, or maintaining basic mechatronics systems. Given the breadth
of technical expertise involved with knowledge and use of modern equipment in
mechatronics engineering technology, and the unique objectives of individual programs,
some baccalaureate programs may focus on preparing graduates with in-depth but
narrow expertise, while other programs may choose to prepare graduates with expertise
in a broad spectrum of the field. Therefore, the depth and breadth of expertise
demonstrated by baccalaureate graduates must be appropriate to support the
educational objectives of the program. The following curricular areas are required:

```
a. Mechatronics component and system integration; tooling and assembly (with
respect to digital and analog electrical components and circuits; embedded
systems and control; mechanics (statics and dynamics); pneumatic, hydraulic,
industrial controls; automation and PLCs);
b. Mechatronics systems software analysis tools, programming and control systems
engineering; connectivity, industrial communication protocols and information
security;
c. Design, selection, set-up, and calibration of measurement tools, instrumentation
and sensors;
d. Troubleshooting of mechatronics system including test and adjust, maintenance
or repair;
e. Preparation of laboratory reports and systems integration, drawings associated
with development, installation, or maintenance of mechatronics components and
systems;
f. Familiarity with and use of industry codes, specifications, and standards;
g. Statistics, quality and continuous improvement techniques, and industrial
organization and management; and
h. Capstone or integrating experience that illustrates skills acquired in the program
applying both technical and non-technical skills in successfully solving industrial
mechatronics problems.
