The following section presents proposed changes to these criteria as approved by the
ABET Engineering Technology Area Delegation on October 25, 2024 for a 180-day review
and comment period. Comments will be considered until June 15, 2025. The ABET
Engineering Technology Area Delegation will determine, based on the comments
received and on the advice of the ETAC, the content of the adopted criteria. The adopted
criteria will then become effective following the ABET Engineering Technology Area
Delegation meeting in the fall of 2025 and would first be applied by the ETAC for
accreditation reviews during the 2026-27 accreditation review cycle.
