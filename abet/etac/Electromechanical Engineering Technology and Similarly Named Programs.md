These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
electromechanical or similar modifiers in their titles.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in the
building, installation, application, and operation and/or maintenance of
electromechanical hardware and software systems. Graduates of associate degree
programs typically have strengths in the building, installation, application, and
operation and maintenance of electromechanical hardware and software systems.

The following curricular areas are required:

```
a. application of computer-aided drafting or design tools to prepare graphical
representations of electromechanical systems;
b. application of circuit analysis, analog and digital electronics, basic
instrumentation, associated software and computers to aid in the
characterization, analysis, and troubleshooting of electromechanical systems;
and
c. application of statics, dynamics (or applied mechanics), strength of materials,
engineering materials, engineering standards, and manufacturing processes to
aid in the characterization, analysis, and troubleshooting of electromechanical
systems.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in the
design, building, installation, application, and operation and/or maintenance of
electromechanical hardware and software systems. Graduates of baccalaureate degree
programs are well prepared for applied design, development, and management of
electromechanical systems. Given the breadth of technical expertise involved with
electromechanical systems, and the unique objectives of individual programs, some
baccalaureate programs may focus on providing in-depth but narrow instruction, while
other programs may choose to provide instruction in a broad spectrum of the field. The
following curricular areas are required:

```
a. graphical representations of electromechanical systems;
```

b. application of circuit analysis, analog and digital electronics, basic
instrumentation, associated software and computers to aid in the
characterization, analysis, and troubleshooting of electromechanical systems;
c. application of statics, dynamics (or applied mechanics), strength of materials,
engineering materials, engineering standards, and manufacturing processes to
aid in the characterization, analysis, and troubleshooting of electromechanical
systems;

d. appropriate computer programming languages for operating electromechanical
systems;
e. electrical/electronic devices such as amplifiers, motors, relays, power systems,
and computer and instrumentation systems for applied design, operation, or
troubleshooting electromechanical systems;
f. advanced topics in engineering mechanics, engineering materials, and fluid
mechanics for applied design, operation, or troubleshooting of electromechanical
systems;
g. fundamentals of control systems for the applied design, operation, or
troubleshooting of electromechanical systems;
h. utilization of differential and integral calculus, as a minimum, to characterize the
static and dynamic performance of electromechanical systems; and

i. application of project management techniques in the investigation, analysis, and
design of electromechanical systems.
