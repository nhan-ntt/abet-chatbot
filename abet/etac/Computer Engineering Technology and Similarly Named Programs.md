These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include computer
or similar modifiers in their titles.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must enable the program to provide graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern tools in computer engineering
technology. Graduates of associate degree programs have strengths in the building,
testing, operation, and maintenance of computer systems and their associated software
systems. The curriculum must include instruction in the following topics:

```
a. application of electric circuits, computer programming, associated software
applications, analog and digital electronics, microcontrollers, operating systems,
local area networks, and engineering standards to the building, testing,
operation, and maintenance of computer systems and associated software
systems; and
b. application of natural sciences and mathematics at or above the level of algebra
and trigonometry to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
computer systems and associated software systems.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide graduates with instruction in the knowledge, techniques,
skills, and use of modern tools in computer engineering technology. Graduates of
baccalaureate degree graduates are well prepared for development and implementation
of computer systems. Given the breadth of technical expertise involved with computer
systems, and the unique objectives of individual programs, some baccalaureate
programs may focus on in-depth but narrow fields of instruction, while other programs
may choose to provide instruction in a broad spectrum of the field. The curriculum
must include instruction in the following topics:

```
a. application of electric circuits, computer programming, associated software
applications, analog and digital electronics, microcontrollers, operating systems,
local area networks, and engineering standards to the building, testing,
operation, and maintenance of computer systems and associated software
systems;
b. application of natural sciences and mathematics at or above the level of algebra
and trigonometry to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
computer systems and associated software systems;
c. analysis, design, and implementation of computer system hardware and software;
d. application of project management techniques to computer systems; and
```

e. utilization of statistics/probability, transform methods, discrete mathematics, or
applied differential equations in support of computer systems and networks.
