These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
telecommunications or similar modifiers in their titles.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide graduates with instruction in the knowledge, techniques,
skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in the application, installation,
management, operation, and/or maintenance of telecommunication systems. Graduates
of associate degree programs have strengths in the building, testing, operation, and
maintenance of telecommunication systems. The curriculum must include instruction in
the following topics:

```
a. application of electric circuits, computer programming, associated software
applications, analog and digital electronics, voice and data communications and
engineering standards, and the principle of telecommunications systems in the
solution of telecommunications problems; and
b. application of natural sciences and mathematics at or above the level of algebra
and trigonometry to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
telecommunication systems.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must enable the program to provide graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in
design, application, installation, management, operation, and/or maintenance of
telecommunications systems. Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs are well
prepared for development and implementation of telecommunications systems. Given
the breath of technical expertise involved with telecommunication systems, and the
unique objectives of individual programs, some baccalaureate programs may provide
instruction with an in-depth but narrow expertise, while other programs may choose to
provide instruction in a broad spectrum of the fields. The curriculum must include
instruction in the following topics:

```
a. application of electric circuits, computer programming, associated software
applications, analog and digital electronics, voice and data communications and
engineering standards, and the principle of telecommunications systems in the
solution of telecommunications problems;
b. application of natural sciences and mathematics at or above the level of algebra
and trigonometry to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
telecommunication systems;
c. analysis, design, and implementation of telecommunications systems;
```

d. application of project management techniques in the design, maintenance and
implementation of telecommunication systems;
e. analysis, and implementation of switching technologies, wired and wireless
networking technologies, and policy;
f. management, design, and planning of telecommunication and computer networks;
and
g. utilization of statistics/probability, transform methods, or applied differential
equations in support of telecommunication systems and computer networks.
