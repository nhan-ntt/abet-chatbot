These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include civil or
similar modifiers in their titles. Graduates of civil engineering technology programs will
have the technical and managerial skills necessary to enter careers in the planning,
design, construction, operation or maintenance of the built environment and global
infrastructure.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

Graduates of associate degree programs typically enter careers in construction testing,
operation, and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure and may produce and
utilize basic construction documents and perform basic analysis and design of system
components. The curriculum must provide instruction in the following curricular areas:

```
a. utilization of principles, hardware, and software that are appropriate to produce
drawings, reports, quantity estimates, and other documents related to civil
engineering;
b. performance of standardized field and laboratory tests related to civil
engineering;
c. utilization of surveying methods appropriate for land measurement and/or
construction layout; and
d. application of fundamental computational methods and elementary analytical
techniques in sub-disciplines related to civil engineering.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs typically analyze and design systems,
specify project methods and materials, perform cost estimates and analyses, and
manage technical activities in support of civil engineering projects. The curriculum
must provide instruction in the following curricular areas:

```
a. utilization of principles, hardware, and software that are appropriate to produce
drawings, reports, quantity estimates, and other documents related to civil
engineering;
b. performance of standardized field and laboratory tests related to civil
engineering;
c. utilization of surveying methods appropriate for land measurement and/or
construction layout;
d. application of fundamental computational methods and elementary analytical
techniques in sub-disciplines related to civil engineering;
e. planning and preparation of documents appropriate for design and construction;
```

f. performance of economic analyses and cost estimates related to design,
construction, operations and maintenance of systems associated with civil
engineering;
g. selection of appropriate engineering materials and practices; and
h. performance of standard analysis and design in at least three sub-disciplines
related to civil engineering.
