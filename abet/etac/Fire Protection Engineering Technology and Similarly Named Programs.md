These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include fire
protection or similar modifiers in their titles. An accreditable program in fire protection
engineering technology will prepare graduates with instruction in knowledge, hands-on
skills and problem-solving ability related to fire protection in the built environment,
including fire protection analysis, knowledge of codes and standards, fire science and
human behavior, fire protection systems, and passive building systems and
construction as they relate to fire protection. The curriculum shall provide instruction
in the concepts of ethical professional practice and the roles and responsibilities of
public institutions and private organizations pertaining to fire protection engineering
technology. Level and scope of career preparation will depend on the degree level and
specific program orientation as portrayed by its educational objectives.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in fire protection
engineering technology. Graduates typically enter the profession as engineering
technicians or transfer to a baccalaureate degree program as appropriate to the
programâ€™s educational objectives. Graduates of associate degree programs typically will
have knowledge in the areas of fire science, fire detection and alarm systems, fire
protection systems, fire prevention, and fire investigation. The curriculum must include
instruction in the following topics:

```
a. basic fire science;
b. fire safety strategies, fire inspection, fire prevention and mitigation;
c. active fire protection systems including detection, alarm, and suppression
systems; and
d. building materials, construction methods and passive fire protection systems.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in fire protection
engineering technology. Baccalaureate degree graduates build on the strengths of
associate degree programs by gaining the knowledge, skills and abilities for entry into
careers in applying mathematics and physical sciences to fire protection design and
analysis using advanced tools and techniques. The curriculum must also include
instruction in the following topics:

```
a. basic fire science;
b. fire safety strategies, fire inspection, fire prevention and mitigation;
```

c. active fire protection systems including detection, alarm, and suppression
systems;
d. building materials, construction methods and passive fire protection systems;

e. fire hazard recognition, evaluation and mitigation;
f. fire risk analysis and fire control;
g. fundamentals of fire and explosion dynamics, and human behavior in fire;

h. codes and standards for life and fire safety;
i. design, analysis, and maintenance of active and passive fire protection systems;
j. hazardous materials and chemistry; and

k. forensic science and scientific method for fire and explosion investigations.
