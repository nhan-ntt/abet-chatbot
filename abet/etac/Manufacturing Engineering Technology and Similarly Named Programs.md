These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
manufacturing or similar modifiers in their titles. An accreditable degree program in
manufacturing engineering technology will provide graduates with instruction in
technical and leadership skills necessary for manufacturing competitiveness and to
enter careers in manufacturing process and systems design, operations, quality,
continuous improvement, lean manufacturing, and sustainability. Level and scope of
career preparation will depend on the degree level and specific program orientation as
portrayed by its program educational objectives.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in manufacturing
engineering technology. Graduates typically enter the professions in manufacturing
operations and service functions or are prepared for transfer to a baccalaureate degree
program, as appropriate to the program educational objectives. The curriculum must
include instruction in the following topics:

```
a. materials and manufacturing processes;
b. product design process, tooling, and assembly;
c. manufacturing systems, automation, and operations; and
d. statistics, quality and continuous improvement, and industrial organization and
management.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in manufacturing
engineering technology. Baccalaureate degree graduates build on the strengths of
associate degree programs by gaining the knowledge, skills, and abilities for entry into
manufacturing careers practicing various tools, techniques and processes. The depth
and breadth of expertise demonstrated by baccalaureate graduates must support the
program educational objectives. The curriculum must include instruction in the
following topics:

```
a. materials and manufacturing processes;
b. product design process, tooling, and assembly;
c. manufacturing systems, automation, and operations;
d. statistics, quality and continuous improvement, and industrial organization and
management; and
```

e. capstone or integrating experience that develops and illustrates student
competencies in applying both technical and non-technical skills in successfully
solving manufacturing problems.
