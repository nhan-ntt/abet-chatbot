These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include chemical,
refinery, process or similar modifiers in their titles.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in chemical engineering
technology. Graduates typically enter the profession as process, maintenance or
laboratory/quality control technicians. Graduates of associate degree programs have
strengths in the safe operation, maintenance and sampling/analysis of chemical
processes. The following curriculum topics are required:

```
a. operating principles, including testing and troubleshooting, of chemical
processes and equipment in accordance with applicable safety (including process
hazards), health and environmental standards;
b. application of chemical engineering principles (such as fluid mechanics, heat
transfer, reactions, and separations) to the operation of chemical processes and
appropriate to program educational objectives;
c. application of instrumentation and process control, quality control, and computer
applications to the operation of chemical processes; and
d. chemistry with laboratory experience and coursework topics in both inorganic
and organic chemistry.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in chemical engineering
technology. Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs build on the strengths of
associate degree programs by gaining the knowledge, skills and abilities for careers in
process design and management. The following curriculum topics are required:

```
a. operating principles (including testing and troubleshooting) of chemical
processes and equipment in accordance with applicable safety (including process
hazards), health and environmental standards;
b. application of chemical engineering principles (such as fluid mechanics, material
and energy balances, heat transfer, reactions, thermodynamics, and separations)
to the design, improvement, and operation of chemical processes and appropriate
to program educational objectives;
c. application of instrumentation and process control, quality control, computer
applications, and materials of construction to the design, improvement, and
operation of chemical processes;
```

d. chemistry with laboratory experience and coursework topics in both inorganic
and organic chemistry; and
e. application of statistical process and quality control to chemical operations.
