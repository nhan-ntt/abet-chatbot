These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include electrical
or electronic(s) or similar modifiers in their titles.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in the
application, installation, manufacturing, operation and/or maintenance of
electrical/electronic(s) systems. Graduates of associate degree programs have strengths
in the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of electrical systems.

The curriculum must include the following topics:

```
a. application of circuit analysis and design, computer programming, associated
software, analog and digital electronics, microcomputers, and engineering
standards to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
electrical/electronic(s) systems; and
b. application of natural sciences and mathematics at or above the level of algebra
and trigonometry to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
electrical/electronic systems.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in the
design, application, installation, manufacturing, operation and/or maintenance of
electrical/electronic(s) systems. Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs are well
prepared for development and implementation of electrical/electronic(s) systems. Given
the breadth of technical expertise involved with electrical systems, and the unique
objectives of individual programs, some baccalaureate programs may focus on
preparing graduates with in-depth but narrow expertise, while other programs may
choose to prepare graduates with expertise in a broad spectrum of the field. Therefore,
the depth and breadth of expertise demonstrated by baccalaureate graduates must be
appropriate to support the program educational objectives.

The curriculum must include the following topics:

```
a. application of circuit analysis and design, computer programming, associated
software, analog and digital electronics, microcontrollers, and engineering
standards to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
electrical/electronic(s) systems;
```

b. application of natural sciences and mathematics at or above the level of
trigonometry to the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
electrical/electronic systems;
c. analysis, design, and implementation of one or more of the following: control
systems, instrumentation systems, communications systems, computer systems,
power systems or energy systems;
d. application of project management techniques to electrical/electronic(s) systems;
and
e. utilization of differential and integral calculus, as a minimum, to characterize the
performance of electrical/electronic systems.
