These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
construction or similar modifiers in their titles. Graduates of construction engineering
technology programs will have the technical skills necessary to enter careers in
construction, operation and/or maintenance of the built environment and global
infrastructure.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

Graduates of associate degree programs typically enter careers in the construction,
testing, operation, and maintenance of buildings and infrastructure; they may also
utilize basic construction documents to participate in construction activities. The
curriculum must provide instruction in the following curricular areas:

```
a. utilization of techniques that are appropriate to administer and evaluate
construction contracts, documents, and codes;
b. estimation of costs, estimation of quantities, and evaluation of materials for
construction projects;
c. utilization of measuring methods, hardware, and software that are appropriate
for field, laboratory, and office processes related to construction; and
d. application of fundamental computational methods and elementary analytical
techniques in sub-disciplines related to construction engineering.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs typically specify project methods and
materials, perform cost estimates and analyses, and manage construction activities. The
curriculum must provide instruction in the following curricular areas:

```
a. utilization of techniques that are appropriate to administer and evaluate
construction contracts, documents, and codes;
b. estimation of costs, estimation of quantities, and evaluation of materials for
construction projects;
c. utilization of measuring methods, hardware, and software that are appropriate
for field, laboratory, and office processes related to construction;
d. application of fundamental computational methods and elementary analytical
techniques in sub-disciplines related to construction engineering;
e. production and utilization of documents related to design, construction, and
operations;
f. performance of economic analyses and cost estimates related to design,
construction, and maintenance of systems associated with construction
engineering;
g. selection of appropriate construction materials and practices;
```

h. application of appropriate principles of construction management, law, and
ethics; and
i. performance of standard analysis and design in at least one sub-discipline
related to construction engineering.
