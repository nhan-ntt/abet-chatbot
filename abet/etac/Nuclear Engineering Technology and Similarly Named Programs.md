### Nuclear Engineering Technology and Similarly Named Programs

```
Lead Society: American Nuclear Society
```
These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include nuclear
or similar modifiers in their titles.

An accredited program in nuclear engineering technology will prepare graduates with
instruction in the knowledge, skills, and problem-solving abilities required to enter
careers in those parts of the nuclear industry served by the program. Graduates of
programs in nuclear engineering technology will have strengths in the areas of nuclear
processes and operations, nuclear systems, and radiological safety, developed from an
understanding of the fundamental principles, conservation laws, and rate processes of
the physical sciences, and the importance of the safe operation of nuclear systems.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use and maintenance of modern equipment in
nuclear engineering technology. The following topics or activities are required:

```
a. Nuclear systems and operations, and radiological safety, including:
```
1. radiation protection procedures,
2. current applicable rules and regulations, maintenance, control,
    performance, the human interface in operations, and quality assurance
    pertaining to the operation of nuclear systems; and
3. the importance of the safe operation of nuclear systems;
b. Problem solving using foundation mathematics and the fundamental principles,
conservation laws, and rate processes of the physical sciences commonly
encountered in segments of the nuclear industry served by the program; and
c. Analyzing and interpreting laboratory analyses measuring nuclear and radiation
processes.

**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use and maintenance of modern equipment in
nuclear engineering technology. The following curriculum topics are required:

```
