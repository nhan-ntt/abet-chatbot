### Aeronautical Engineering Technology and Similarly Named Programs

```

These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
aeronautical or similar modifiers in their titles. Much of aeronautical/aerospace
engineering technology involves the translation of engineering ideas and concepts into
functioning vehicles, engines, avionics, mission systems, payloads and components. It
is anticipated that fundamental experiential skills may incorporate portions of the
approved FAA Airframe and Powerplant or equivalent curriculum.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in aeronautical engineering
technology. Graduates of associate degree programs typically have strengths in
specifying, installing, fabricating, testing, documenting, operating, selling, or
maintaining basic support and manufacturing practices for aeronautical/aerospace
vehicle, ground support systems and component support. The curriculum must contain
the following curricular areas:

```
a. a minimum of three subject areas chosen from: engineering materials, applied
structures, applied mechanics, applied aerodynamics, applied propulsion, and
fundamentals of electricity;
b. assembly and support processes, industry standards, regulations and
documentation, and computer-aided engineering graphics with added technical
depth in at least one of these areas; and
c. applied physics having an emphasis in applied mechanics and other technical
topics in physics appropriate to the program objectives.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in
applying the knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in
aeronautical engineering technology to the analysis, development, implementation, or
oversight of aeronautical/aerospace systems and processes. The curriculum must
contain the following curricular areas:

```
a. engineering materials, statics, strength of materials, applied aerodynamics,
applied propulsion, and either electrical power or electronics
b. added depth in a minimum of three subject areas chosen from: manufacturing
processes, vehicle design and modification, engineering materials, electro-
mechanical devices and controls, industrial operations, and systems engineering
including the appreciation of the engineering design cycle and the system life
cycle relating to the manufacture and maintenance of aeronautical/aerospace
vehicles and their components; and
```

c. applied physics having an emphasis in applied mechanics, plus added technical
topics in physics and other science principles appropriate to the program
objectives.
