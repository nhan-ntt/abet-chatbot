### Criterion 6. Faculty

Each faculty member teaching in the program must have expertise and educational
background consistent with the contributions to the program expected from the faculty
member. The competence of faculty members must be demonstrated by such factors as
education, professional credentials and certifications, professional experience, ongoing
professional development, contributions to the discipline, teaching effectiveness,
communication skills, and other factors important to the program. Collectively, the
faculty must have the breadth and depth to cover all curricular areas of the program.
Program Criteria may add specificity to faculty requirements.

The faculty serving in the program must be of sufficient number to maintain continuity,
stability, oversight, student interaction, and advising. The faculty must have sufficient
responsibility and authority to improve the program through definition and revision of
program educational objectives and student outcomes as well as through the
implementation of a program of study that fosters the attainment of student outcomes.
