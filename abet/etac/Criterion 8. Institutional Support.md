### Criterion 8. Institutional Support

Institutional support, resources, and leadership must be sufficient to: a) ensure the
quality and continuity of the program; b) attract, retain, and provide for the continued
professional development of a qualified faculty; c) acquire, maintain, and operate
infrastructures, facilities and equipment appropriate for the program; and d) create and
foster a respectful environment among the programâ€™s students, faculty, staff, and
administrators such that the student outcomes can be attained. Resources include
institutional services and policies, financial support, and administrative and technical
staff.


## II. PROGRAM CRITERIA

Each program seeking accreditation from the Engineering Technology Accreditation
Commission of ABET must satisfy all applicable Program Criteria. Applicability is
determined by the official program title as it appears on the most recent request for
ABET evaluation. Program Criteria provide specific requirements needed for
interpretation of General Criteria for a given discipline. Requirements stipulated in
Program Criteria are limited to curriculum and faculty. If a program, by virtue of its
program title, becomes subject to two or more sets of Program Criteria, that program
must satisfy each set of Program Criteria. However, overlapping requirements need be
satisfied only once.
