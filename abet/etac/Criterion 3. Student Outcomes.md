### Criterion 3. Student Outcomes

The program must have documented student outcomes with a documented and effective
process for the periodic review and revision of these student outcomes.

For purposes of this section, well-defined activities or problems are practical, narrow in
scope, use conventional processes and materials in traditional ways, and require
knowledge of standard operating processes. Broadly-defined activities or problems are
practical, broad in scope, relatively complex, and involve a variety of resources; use new
processes, materials, or techniques in innovative ways; and may require extension of
standard operating procedures.

A. For associate degree programs, these student outcomes must include, but are not
limited to, the following elements:

```
(1) an ability to apply knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools of
mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to solve well-defined
engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
(2) an ability to design solutions for well-defined technical problems and assist with
the engineering design of systems, components, or processes appropriate to the
discipline;
(3) an ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in well-defined
technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use
appropriate technical literature;
```

```
(4) an ability to conduct standard tests, measurements, and experiments and to
analyze and interpret the results; and
(5) an ability to function effectively as a member of a technical team.

B. For baccalaureate degree programs, these student outcomes must include, but are not
limited to, the following elements:

```
(1) an ability to apply knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools of
mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to solve broadly-defined
engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
(2) an ability to design systems, components, or processes meeting specified needs
for broadly-defined engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
(3) an ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in broadly-defined
technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use
appropriate technical literature;
(4) an ability to conduct standard tests, measurements, and experiments and to
analyze and interpret the results to improve processes; and
(5) an ability to function effectively as a member as well as a leader on technical
teams.
