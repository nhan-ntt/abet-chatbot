These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include air
conditioning, HVAC, refrigerating, heating, or ventilating, or similar modifiers in their
titles. The programs prepare graduates with the technical and managerial skills
necessary to enter careers in the design, application installation, manufacturing,
operation, marketing and maintenance of heating, ventilating, air-conditioning, and
refrigeration (HVAC&R) systems.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and ability to use modern equipment in air conditioning,
refrigerating, heating, and ventilating engineering technology. The curriculum must
include instruction in the following topics:

```
a. basic HVAC&R principles, including heat transfer, fluid mechanics, combustion,
air conditioning and refrigeration processes, heating and cooling load
calculations, electrical circuits, and controls;
b. application of HVAC&R principles for well-defined technical activities, including
sizing of pipe and duct, analysis of ladder logic diagrams, evaluation of
equipment performance, and use of computerized tools for energy calculations
and equipment selection; and
c. application of HVAC&R principles for system operations, including
troubleshooting, servicing, and maintenance tasks.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and ability to use modern equipment in air conditioning,
refrigerating, heating, and ventilating engineering technology. Baccalaureate degree
graduates are well prepared for design and development of complex systems
complementing and expanding on lower division work. The curriculum must include
instruction in the following topics:

```
a. basic HVAC&R engineering principles, including heat transfer, fluid mechanics,
combustion, air conditioning and refrigeration processes, heating and cooling
load calculations, electrical circuits, and controls;
b. application of HVAC&R principles for broadly-defined technical activities,
including analysis of equipment and system performance, analysis of system
controls, and computerized evaluation of system energy performance;
```

```
c. design and analysis of HVAC&R systems for commercial buildings, including pipe
and duct design, HVAC&R equipment and system selection, building energy
modeling, and economic analysis; and
d. project management for design and installation of HVAC&R systems.

Faculty

The majority of faculty teaching courses that are primarily design in content must be
qualified to teach the subject matter by professional licensure or by education and
design experience.
