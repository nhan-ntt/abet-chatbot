These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
architectural or similar modifiers in their titles. Graduates of architectural engineering
technology programs will have the technical and managerial skills necessary to enter
careers in the planning, design, construction, operation or maintenance of the built
environment.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

Graduates of associate degree programs typically enter careers in the construction,
testing, operation, and maintenance of building systems; they may also produce and
utilize basic construction documents and perform basic analysis and design of system
components. The curriculum must provide instruction in the following curricular areas:

```
a. employment of architectural theory and design in a design environment;
b. utilization of instruments, methods, software, and techniques that are
appropriate to produce A/E documents and presentations;
c. utilization of measuring methods that are appropriate for field, office, or
laboratory; and
d. application of fundamental computational methods and elementary analytical
techniques in sub-disciplines related to architectural engineering.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

Baccalaureate degree graduates typically enter careers in which they will analyze and
design systems, specify project methods and materials, perform cost estimates and
analyses, and manage technical activities in support of architectural projects. The
curriculum must provide instruction in the following curricular areas:

```
a. employment of architectural theory and design in a design environment;
b. utilization of instruments, methods, software, and techniques that are
appropriate to produce A/E documents and presentations;
c. utilization of measuring methods that are appropriate for field, office, or
laboratory;
d. application of fundamental computational methods and elementary analytical
techniques in sub-disciplines related to architectural engineering;
e. creation, utilization, and presentation of documents related to design,
construction, and operations;
f. performance of economic analyses and cost estimates related to design,
construction, and maintenance of building systems;
g. selection of appropriate materials and practices for building construction;
```

h. application of principles of construction law and ethics in architectural practice;
and
i. performance of standard analysis and design in at least one recognized technical
specialty within architectural engineering technology that is appropriate to the
goals of the program.
