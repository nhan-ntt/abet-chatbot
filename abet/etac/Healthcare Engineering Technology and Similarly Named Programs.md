These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
healthcare, bioengineering, biomedical, biomedical equipment, clinical technology,
medical equipment, medical electronics, or similar modifiers in their titles. An
accreditable program in healthcare engineering technology will prepare graduates with
the technical skills necessary to enter careers to work with clinicians and other
healthcare professionals as part of a team to ensure the highest standards and best
practices in medical device safety, security, interoperability and functionality.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in healthcare engineering
technology. Graduates of associate degree programs will typically work in equipment
planning, purchasing, installation, maintenance, troubleshooting, and on-call technical
support of medical device technology and systems.

The curriculum for associate degree programs must include analog and digital
electronics, medical device principles, applicable codes and regulations, medical
vocabulary, the structure and function of the human body, an internship at a clinical
site, as well as IT concepts including computers, peripherals, networks, and software.
The associate degree curriculum must include the following curricular areas:

```
a. the interaction of medical equipment* with the human body;
b. the principles of medical equipment, safety and operational tests, the use of test
results in order to improve processes and ensure that equipment is functioning
properly and safely with appropriate documentation;
c. information technology principles applied to medical equipment systems,
including data security and privacy standards; and
d. potential unsafe conditions related to the use of medical equipment and systems,
preventative and corrective actions including risk mitigation.

**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in healthcare engineering
technology. Baccalaureate degree graduates typically support the use of medical devices
in healthcare, focusing on selecting safe and effective medical equipment, maintenance


of medical equipment and systems, contribute toward improving patient outcomes,
educating clinical staff, and controlling costs through financial stewardship.

The curriculum for baccalaureate degree programs must include analog and digital
electronics, medical device principles, applicable codes and regulations, medical
vocabulary, the structure and function of the human body, an internship at a clinical
site, as well as IT concepts including computers, peripherals, networks, cybersecurity,
and software. In addition, baccalaureate degree curriculum must include asset
management, imaging modality fundamentals, clinical laboratory equipment
fundamentals, risk analysis, and process improvement. The curriculum must include
the following curricular areas:

```
a. the interaction of medical equipment* with the human body;
b. the principles of medical equipment, safety and operational tests, the use of test
results in order to improve processes and ensure that equipment is functioning
properly and safely with appropriate documentation;
c. the clinical application of computer networks, networking protocols, and medical
device interoperability including data security and privacy standards;
d. potential unsafe conditions related to the use of medical equipment and systems,
preventative and corrective actions including risk mitigation;
e. technology utilized in specialized clinical areas such as patient imaging and the
operating room, including the interconnectedness (connectivity) of medical
devices and systems;
f. the principles of project management to the healthcare setting; and
g. the financial information associated with the process of clinical equipment
acquisition, management and support including budgeting and life-cycle
planning.
