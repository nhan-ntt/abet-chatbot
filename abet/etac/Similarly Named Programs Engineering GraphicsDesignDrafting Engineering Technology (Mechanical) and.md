These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
engineering graphics, design or drafting or similar modifiers in their titles and have an
emphasis on mechanical components and systems. An accreditable program in
engineering graphics or design or drafting engineering technology will prepare
graduates with knowledge, hands-on skills and problem-solving ability to enter careers
related to preparation of engineering drawings and basic design of mechanical
components and systems. Level and scope of career preparation will depend on the
degree level and specific program orientation as portrayed by its program educational
objectives.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in engineering
graphics/design/drafting engineering technology. Graduates typically enter the
profession as engineering technicians or are prepared for transfer to a baccalaureate
degree program, as appropriate to the program educational objectives. Graduates must
have instruction in engineering graphics/drafting, basic mechanical design and
development, specifications related to mechanical components and systems and
manufacturability of components. The following curriculum topics are required:

```
a. use of 3D parametric computer-aided drafting and design software used for a
variety of mechanical drawing techniques (such as orthographic, section,
auxiliary, assembly models, detailed working drawings and rendered images);
b. apply principles of
```
1. geometric dimensioning and tolerancing;
2. fundamentals of engineering materials, applied mechanics;
3. manufacturing methods;
c. use of basic knowledge and familiarity with industry codes, specifications, and
standards (ASME, ANSI or others); and
d. an integrating or capstone experience utilizing skills acquired in the program.

**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must prepare baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in engineering
graphics/design/drafting engineering technology. Baccalaureate degree graduates build
on the strengths of associate degree programs by gaining the knowledge, skills and
abilities for entry into careers in applied mechanical design using advanced software


tools and techniques. The depth and breadth of instruction for baccalaureate graduates
must support the program educational objectives. The following curriculum topics are
required:

```
a. use of 3D parametric computer-aided drafting and design software for a variety
of mechanical drawing techniques (such as orthographic, section, auxiliary,
assembly models, detailed working drawings and rendered images);
b. application of principals of
```
1. geometric dimensioning and tolerancing;
2. fundamentals of engineering materials, applied mechanics;
3. manufacturing methods;
c. applications of calculus and statistics;
d. use of advanced 3D parametric modeling tools for design and analysis;
e. application of physics, materials, manufacturability, environmental and
economic concepts to design of machine or mechanical elements;
f. use of industry codes, specifications and standards (ASME, ANSI or others); and
g. technical communications typically used in preparation of engineering proposals,
reports, and specifications.

The capstone experience, ideally demonstrated via an open-ended project-based
experience, must include a formal design or drafted product with analysis and
presentation materials.
