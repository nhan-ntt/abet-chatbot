### Criterion 4. Continuous Improvement

The program must regularly use appropriate, documented processes for assessing and
evaluating the extent to which the student outcomes are being attained. The results of
these evaluations must be systematically utilized as input for the programâ€™s continuous
improvement actions. Other available information may also be used to assist in the
continuous improvement of the program.
