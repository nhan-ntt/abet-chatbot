These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include marine
or similar modifiers in their titles. The field of marine engineering technology is
dependent on the application of the technical sciences to marine equipment, systems,
and vehicles. An accreditable program will prepare graduates to enter a variety of
different careers in the field of marine engineering technology.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in marine engineering
technology. The curriculum must contain the following topics:

```
a. the use of the principles of college-level physics to problems associated with
marine engineering technology applications;
b. the application of the technical sciences to marine equipment, systems and/or
vehicles;
c. the use and application of modern instrumentation for measuring physical
phenomena related to marine engineering technology, including data collection,
analysis, and formal report writing; and
d. the operation and maintenance of modern marine power plants and associated
marine auxiliary equipment and systems, including the use of design manuals,
material/equipment specifications, and industry regulations applicable to marine
engineering technology.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge, techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in marine engineering
technology. The curriculum must contain the following topics:

```
a. application of the principles of college-level physics and chemistry to problems
associated with marine engineering technology applications;
b. the principles of fluid mechanics, hydrostatic stability, solid mechanics,
materials, dynamics, and thermodynamics and their application to marine
equipment, systems and/or vehicles;
c. the use and application of modern instrumentation for measuring physical
phenomena related to marine engineering technology, including the design of
experiments, data collection, analysis, and formal report writing; and
d. the operation, maintenance, analysis, design and management of modern marine
power plants and associated marine auxiliary equipment and systems, including
the use of design manuals, material/equipment specifications, and industry
regulations applicable to marine engineering technology.
