### Automotive Engineering Technology and Similarly Named Programs

```
Lead Society: SAE, International
```
These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
automotive or similar modifiers in their titles. The term “automotive” refers to land, sea,
air, or space mobility. An accreditable program will prepare graduates with technical
and managerial skills necessary to enter careers in design, manufacturing, marketing,
operation, and maintenance in the field of automotive engineering technology.

Level and scope of career preparation will depend on the degree level and specific
program orientation as portrayed by its educational objectives.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide associate degree graduates with instruction in the
knowledge of operations, maintenance, manufacturing, and use of modern equipment in
automotive engineering technology. Graduates typically enter the profession as
engineering technicians or are prepared for transfer to a baccalaureate degree program,
as appropriate to the program’s educational objectives. The following curricular areas
are required:

```
a. application of computer technologies commonly used in industry, governmental
service, and private practice associated with land, sea, air, or space mobility;
b. application of probability and statistics to the solution of problems related to
land, sea, air, or space mobility; and
c. working knowledge of the design, manufacture, and maintenance of major
subsystems and technologies associated with land, sea, air, or space mobility.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide baccalaureate degree graduates with instruction in design
and management in the automotive field. Baccalaureate degree graduates build on the
strengths of associate degree programs by gaining the knowledge, skills and abilities
for entry into careers in applied design and management. The following curricular areas
are required:

```
a. application of computer technologies commonly used in industry, governmental
service, and private practice associated with land, sea, air, or space mobility;
b. application of probability and statistics to the solution of problems related to
land, sea, air, or space mobility;
c. the design, manufacture, and maintenance of major subsystems and technologies
associated with land, sea, air, or space mobility;
d. application of modern and effective skills in identification and investigation of
problems, analysis of data, synthesis and implementation of solutions, and
operations of facilities related to land, sea, air, or space mobility; and
```

e. The capstone experience, ideally demonstrated via an open-ended project-based
experience, must include a formal design or drafted product with analysis, and
presentation materials.
