## I. GENERAL CRITERIA FOR BACCALAUREATE LEVEL PROGRAMS

### Criterion 1. Students

Student performance must be evaluated. Student progress must be monitored to foster
success in attaining student outcomes, thereby enabling graduates to attain program
educational objectives. Students must be advised regarding curriculum and career
matters.

The program must have and enforce policies for accepting both new and transfer
students, awarding appropriate academic credit for courses taken at other institutions,
and awarding appropriate academic credit for work in lieu of courses taken at the
institution. The program must have and enforce procedures to ensure and document
that students who graduate meet all graduation requirements.

### Criterion 2. Program Educational Objectives

The program must have published program educational objectives that are consistent
with the mission of the institution, the needs of the program’s various constituencies,
and these criteria. There must be a documented, systematically utilized, and effective
process, involving program constituencies, for the periodic review of these program
educational objectives that ensures they remain consistent with the institutional
mission, the program’s constituents’ needs, and these criteria.

### Criterion 3. Student Outcomes

The program must have documented student outcomes with a documented and effective
process for the periodic review and revision of these student outcomes.

For purposes of this section, well-defined activities or problems are practical, narrow in
scope, use conventional processes and materials in traditional ways, and require
knowledge of standard operating processes. Broadly-defined activities or problems are
practical, broad in scope, relatively complex, and involve a variety of resources; use new
processes, materials, or techniques in innovative ways; and may require extension of
standard operating procedures.

A. For associate degree programs, these student outcomes must include, but are not
limited to, the following elements:

```
(1) an ability to apply knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools of
mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to solve well-defined
engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
(2) an ability to design solutions for well-defined technical problems and assist with
the engineering design of systems, components, or processes appropriate to the
discipline;
(3) an ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in well-defined
technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use
appropriate technical literature;
```

```
(4) an ability to conduct standard tests, measurements, and experiments and to
analyze and interpret the results; and
(5) an ability to function effectively as a member of a technical team.
```
B. For baccalaureate degree programs, these student outcomes must include, but are not
limited to, the following elements:

```
(1) an ability to apply knowledge, techniques, skills and modern tools of
mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to solve broadly-defined
engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
(2) an ability to design systems, components, or processes meeting specified needs
for broadly-defined engineering problems appropriate to the discipline;
(3) an ability to apply written, oral, and graphical communication in broadly-defined
technical and non-technical environments; and an ability to identify and use
appropriate technical literature;
(4) an ability to conduct standard tests, measurements, and experiments and to
analyze and interpret the results to improve processes; and
(5) an ability to function effectively as a member as well as a leader on technical
teams.
```
### Criterion 4. Continuous Improvement

The program must regularly use appropriate, documented processes for assessing and
evaluating the extent to which the student outcomes are being attained. The results of
these evaluations must be systematically utilized as input for the program’s continuous
improvement actions. Other available information may also be used to assist in the
continuous improvement of the program.

### Criterion 5. Curriculum

Curricular requirements specify topics appropriate to engineering technology but do not
prescribe courses. The curriculum must combine technical, professional and general
education components in support of student outcomes. To differentiate the discipline,
Program Criteria may add specificity for program curricula. The curriculum must
include the following:

Mathematics: The program must develop the ability of students to apply mathematics
to the solution of technical problems.

A. Associate degree curricula will include the application of algebra and trigonometry at
a level appropriate to the student outcomes and the discipline.

B. Baccalaureate degree curricula will include the application of integral and
differential calculus, or other mathematics above the level of algebra and trigonometry,
appropriate to the student outcomes and the discipline.

Discipline Specific Content: The discipline specific content of the curriculum must focus
on the applied aspects of science and engineering and must:


```
a. Represent at least one-third of the total credit hours for the curriculum but no
more than two-thirds of the total credit hours for the curriculum;
b. Include a technical core preparing students for the increasingly complex
technical specialties later in the curriculum;
c. Develop student competency in the discipline;
d. Include design considerations appropriate to the discipline and degree level such
as: industry and engineering standards and codes; public safety and health; and
local and global impact of engineering solutions on individuals, organizations
and society; and
e. Combine technical, professional, and general education components to prepare
students for a career, further study, and lifelong professional development.
```
Other Content: The curriculum must include topics related to professional and ethical
responsibilities; quality; and continuous improvement.

Natural Science: The natural science content of the curriculum must be appropriate to
the discipline and must include laboratory experiences.

The Integration of Content: Baccalaureate degree curricula must provide a capstone or
integrating experience that develops student competencies in applying both technical
and non-technical skills in solving problems.

Cooperative Education: When used to satisfy degree requirements, credits based upon
cooperative/internships or similar experiences must include an appropriate academic
component evaluated by a member of the program faculty.

Advisory Committee: An advisory committee with representation from organizations
being served by the program graduates must periodically review the program’s
educational objectives and curriculum. The advisory committee must provide
advisement on current and future aspects of the technical fields for which the graduates
are being prepared.

### Criterion 6. Faculty

Each faculty member teaching in the program must have expertise and educational
background consistent with the contributions to the program expected from the faculty
member. The competence of faculty members must be demonstrated by such factors as
education, professional credentials and certifications, professional experience, ongoing
professional development, contributions to the discipline, teaching effectiveness,
communication skills, and other factors important to the program. Collectively, the
faculty must have the breadth and depth to cover all curricular areas of the program.
Program Criteria may add specificity to faculty requirements.

The faculty serving in the program must be of sufficient number to maintain continuity,
stability, oversight, student interaction, and advising. The faculty must have sufficient
responsibility and authority to improve the program through definition and revision of
program educational objectives and student outcomes as well as through the
implementation of a program of study that fosters the attainment of student outcomes.


### Criterion 7. Facilities

Classrooms, offices, laboratories, and associated equipment must be adequate to
support attainment of the student outcomes and to provide an atmosphere conducive to
learning. Modern tools, equipment, computing resources, and laboratories appropriate
to the program must be available and systematically maintained and upgraded to
enable students to attain the student outcomes and to support program needs. Students
must be provided appropriate guidance regarding the use of the tools, equipment,
computing resources, and laboratories available to the program.

The library services and the computing and information infrastructure must be
adequate to support the scholarly and professional activities of the students and
faculty.

### Criterion 8. Institutional Support

Institutional support, resources, and leadership must be sufficient to: a) ensure the
quality and continuity of the program; b) attract, retain, and provide for the continued
professional development of a qualified faculty; c) acquire, maintain, and operate
infrastructures, facilities and equipment appropriate for the program; and d) create and
foster a respectful environment among the program’s students, faculty, staff, and
administrators such that the student outcomes can be attained. Resources include
institutional services and policies, financial support, and administrative and technical
staff.
