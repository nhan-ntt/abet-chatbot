### Mechanical Engineering Technology and Similarly Named Programs

Lead Society: American Society of Mechanical Engineers

These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
mechanical or similar modifiers in their titles. An accreditable program in mechanical
engineering technology prepares graduates with knowledge, problem-solving ability
and hands-on skills to enter careers in the design, installation, manufacturing, testing,
technical sales, maintenance, and other endeavors typically associated with mechanical
components and systems. Programs emphasize how things actually work, how they are
made, and the realization that most mechanical components and assemblies become
parts of complex systems, an important consideration realized at the beginning of the
design process. Level and scope of career preparation will depend on the degree level
and specific program orientation.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must prepare associate degree graduates with the knowledge,
techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in mechanical engineering technology.
Graduates must have strengths in specifying, installing, building, testing, documenting,
operating, selling or maintaining basic mechanical systems. Programs prepare
graduates for entry into industry as engineering technicians or for transfer to a
baccalaureate degree program as appropriate to support the program educational
objectives. The following curricular topics are required (unless the program’s faculty
and primary constituents approve the substitution of other specific, mechanically-
related technical subjects supporting attainment of program educational objectives):

```
a. Application of principles of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing;
b. Use of computer aided drafting and design software;
c. Selection, set-up, and calibration of measurement tools/instrumentation;
d. Preparation of laboratory reports and systems documentation associated with
development, installation, or maintenance of mechanical components and
systems;
e. Basic familiarity and use of industry codes, specifications, and standards;
f. Use of basic engineering mechanics; and
g. An integrating or capstone experience utilizing skills acquired in the program.
```
Faculty

The program must demonstrate that faculty members are maintaining currency in their
specialty areas.

**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must prepare baccalaureate degree graduates with the knowledge,
techniques, skills, and use of modern equipment in mechanical engineering technology.


Baccalaureate degree graduates build on the strengths of associate degree programs by
gaining proficiency in the analysis, applied design, development, implementation or
oversight of more advanced mechanical components, systems or processes. Programs
may focus on preparing graduates with in-depth but narrow expertise, while other
programs may choose to prepare graduates with a broad spectrum of expertise. The
depth and breadth of expertise demonstrated by baccalaureate graduates must support
the program educational objectives. The following curricular topics are required (unless
the program’s faculty and primary constituents approve the substitution of other
specific, mechanically-related technical subjects supporting attainment of program
educational objectives):

```
a. Application of principles of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing;
b. Use of computer aided drafting and design software;
c. Perform selection, set-up, and calibration of measurement tools/instrumentation;
d. Elements of differential and integral calculus;
e. Manufacturing processes;
f. Material science and selection;
g. Solid mechanics (such as statics, dynamics, strength of materials, etc.);
h. Mechanical system design;
i. Thermal sciences (such as thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, etc.);
j. Electrical circuits (ac and dc) and electronic controls;
k. Application of industry codes, specifications and standards; and
l. Technical communications typically used in preparation of engineering
proposals, reports, and specifications.
```
The capstone experience, ideally multidisciplinary in nature, must be project-based and
include formal design, implementation and test processes.

Faculty

The program must demonstrate that faculty members are maintaining currency in their
specialty areas.
