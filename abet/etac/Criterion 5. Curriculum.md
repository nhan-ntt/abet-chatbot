### Criterion 5. Curriculum

Curricular requirements specify topics appropriate to engineering technology but do not
prescribe courses. The curriculum must combine technical, professional and general
education components in support of student outcomes. To differentiate the discipline,
Program Criteria may add specificity for program curricula. The curriculum must
include the following:

Mathematics: The program must develop the ability of students to apply mathematics
to the solution of technical problems.

A. Associate degree curricula will include the application of algebra and trigonometry at
a level appropriate to the student outcomes and the discipline.

B. Baccalaureate degree curricula will include the application of integral and
differential calculus, or other mathematics above the level of algebra and trigonometry,
appropriate to the student outcomes and the discipline.

Discipline Specific Content: The discipline specific content of the curriculum must focus
on the applied aspects of science and engineering and must:


```
a. Represent at least one-third of the total credit hours for the curriculum but no
more than two-thirds of the total credit hours for the curriculum;
b. Include a technical core preparing students for the increasingly complex
technical specialties later in the curriculum;
c. Develop student competency in the discipline;
d. Include design considerations appropriate to the discipline and degree level such
as: industry and engineering standards and codes; public safety and health; and
local and global impact of engineering solutions on individuals, organizations
and society; and
e. Combine technical, professional, and general education components to prepare
students for a career, further study, and lifelong professional development.
```
Other Content: The curriculum must include topics related to professional and ethical
responsibilities; quality; and continuous improvement.

Natural Science: The natural science content of the curriculum must be appropriate to
the discipline and must include laboratory experiences.

The Integration of Content: Baccalaureate degree curricula must provide a capstone or
integrating experience that develops student competencies in applying both technical
and non-technical skills in solving problems.

Cooperative Education: When used to satisfy degree requirements, credits based upon
cooperative/internships or similar experiences must include an appropriate academic
component evaluated by a member of the program faculty.

Advisory Committee: An advisory committee with representation from organizations
being served by the program graduates must periodically review the programâ€™s
educational objectives and curriculum. The advisory committee must provide
advisement on current and future aspects of the technical fields for which the graduates
are being prepared.
