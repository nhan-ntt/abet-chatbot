These program criteria apply to engineering technology programs that include
information, information security, cybersecurity, information assurance or similar
modifiers in their titles.

**I. Program Criteria for Associate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide graduates with instruction in the knowledge, techniques,
skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in the application, installation,
operation and/or maintenance of computer systems, networks, and telecommunications
systems dedicated to the processing and transfer of information. Graduates of associate
degree programs in Information Engineering Technology have strengths in the building,
testing, operation, and maintenance of hardware and software systems. Graduates of
associate degree programs that contain the modifier “information security,”
“cybersecurity,” or “information assurance” in the title will also have strengths in
computer and network security.

The curriculum must include instruction in the following topics:

```
a. application of computer and network hardware, operating systems, system and
network administration, programming languages, applications software, and
databases in the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of hardware and
software systems;
b. application of electrical, electronic, telecommunications, and digital signal
propagation fundamentals in the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
hardware and software systems; and
c. Application of legal, ethical and security issues involving data and information
```
The curriculum for programs containing the modifier “information security,”
“cybersecurity” or “information assurance” in the title must also include instruction in:

```
d. application of cybersecurity principles, techniques and tools to protect devices
and systems that incorporate interconnected hardware and software, and human
aspects of a system.
```
**II. Program Criteria for Baccalaureate Level Programs**

Curriculum

The curriculum must provide graduates with instruction in the knowledge, techniques,
skills and use of modern tools necessary to enter careers in the design, application,
installation, operation and/or maintenance of computer systems, networks, and
telecommunications systems dedicated to the processing and transfer of information.
Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs in Information Engineering Technology are


well prepared for design, development, and management of computer systems,
networks, and telecommunication systems. Graduates of baccalaureate degree programs
that contain the modifier “information security,” “cybersecurity” or “information
assurance” in the title will also be well prepared for design of secure systems,
evaluation and measurement of security risk, and ensure proper levels of privacy are
maintained.

Given the breadth of technical expertise involved with information systems, and the
unique objectives of individual programs, some baccalaureate programs may provide
instruction with in-depth but narrow focus, while other programs may choose to
provide instruction in a broad spectrum of the field. The curriculum must include
instruction in the following topics:

```
a. application of computer and network hardware, operating systems, system and
network administration, programming languages, applications software, and
databases in the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of hardware and
software systems;
b. application of electrical, electronic, telecommunications, and digital signal
propagation fundamentals in the building, testing, operation, and maintenance of
hardware and software systems;
c. application of legal, ethical and security issues involving data and information.
d. design, implementation, maintenance, and security of facilities involved with the
processing and transfer of information;
e. application of project management techniques to facilities that process and
transfer information; and
f. utilization of discrete mathematics, and probability and statistics in the support
of facilities that process and transfer information.
```
The curriculum for programs containing the modifiers “information security,”
“cybersecurity” or “information assurance” in the title must also include instruction in
the following topics:

```
g. application of cybersecurity principles, techniques and tools to protect devices
and systems that incorporate interconnected hardware and software, and human
aspects of a system;
h. design, implementation, maintenance, and security of facilities involved with the
processing and transfer of data and information; and
i. procurement, testing analysis and maintenance of components interconnected
into larger systems.
