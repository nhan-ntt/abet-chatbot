## II. PROGRAM CRITERIA

Each program seeking accreditation from the Engineering Technology Accreditation
Commission of ABET must satisfy all applicable Program Criteria. Applicability is
determined by the official program title as it appears on the most recent request for
ABET evaluation. Program Criteria provide specific requirements needed for
interpretation of General Criteria for a given discipline. Requirements stipulated in
Program Criteria are limited to curriculum and faculty. If a program, by virtue of its
