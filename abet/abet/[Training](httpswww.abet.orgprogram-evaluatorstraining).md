With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

Program Evaluator Candidate Training >
After completing the
ABET Program Evaluator Application
and being approved by one of our professional and technical societies, prospective program evaluators participate in Program Evaluator Candidate (PEVC) Training. This training is designed to simulate the actual ABET program review process. Successful completion of PEVC Training results in becoming an ABET program evaluator. The entire PEVC Training process consists of three separate steps:
Online pre-work
Simulated Visit Training
Society-specific training (if applicable)
The online portion of PEVC Training typically takes 20-25 hours and requires written work and the completion of three proficiency assessments. After the online training is complete, PEVCs then attend Simulated Visit Training, which is a facilitated experiential workshop that simulates an accreditation visit. The online training must be completed at least four weeks before Simulated Visit Training.
PEVCs who successfully complete both the online pre-work and Simulated Visit Training may then be approved by their member society to serve as a program evaluator. Some societies require
additional specialized training
, which is conducted separately.
The entire PEVC Training process begins in January and ends in June.

Program Evaluator Pre-Review Preparation Training >
This is ABET’s online training course for program evaluators assigned to evaluate a program. Program Evaluator Pre-Review Preparation Training provides critical updates on commission-specific changes that will affect the review process, as well as updates to policy and procedures. Program evaluators are encouraged to complete this training upon assignment and prior to reviewing the program’s self-study report. It should be complete no later than weeks before their visit. This course is available for the duration of each accreditation cycle.
Program Evaluator Recertification Training >
This is ABET’s online recertification training course for program evaluators who have been inactive for more than two years or who have not completed formal training in the past five years. It is designed to ensure consistency in the review process by providing program evaluators an opportunity to reconnect with the accreditation process, as well to become current with the latest updates to ABET criteria, policy and procedures.
Training for Accreditation Visits Outside of the U.S. >
This ABET training course is a primer for Program Evaluators participating in accreditation visits outside of the United States. It can also be used as refresher training for those who have previously participated in accreditation visits to programs outside of the United States. This course is available online and is to be completed at least three weeks before the assigned visit.
New Commissioner Training >
Many successful program evaluators ascend into leadership roles within ABET as commissioners. This training is available online and should be completed by newly appointed commissioners approximately six weeks before the annual July Commission Meetings.
Preparing for a Visit with Online Components >
Most programs today use an LMS (Learning Management System) such as BlackBoard, Canvas, Moodle, or Brightspace. Additionally, many programs are wholly or partially online. This course contains resources that provide useful insights, information and tools to prepare volunteer experts for a visit with online components.
Virtual Review Training >
This course prepares review teams to conduct virtual reviews. Focusing on what is common among commissions, Virtual Review Training helps team chairs and program evaluators maintain the quality and consistency of an ABET review in a 100% virtual environment.
