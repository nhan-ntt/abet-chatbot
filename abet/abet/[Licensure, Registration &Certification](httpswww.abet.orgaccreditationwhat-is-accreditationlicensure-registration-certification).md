With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

## [Licensure, Registration &Certification](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/what-is-accreditation/licensure-registration-certification/)

Graduates of ABET-accredited programs who work in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology can seek professional recognition by enhancing their credentials through licensure, registration and certification programs where appropriate. Graduation from an ABET-accredited program is increasingly a required minimum credential for such professional recognition.

ABET does not provide licensure, registration or certification services for individuals. However, throughout our history, we have contributed significantly to the education of students who later seek official recognition of their qualifications to serve the public.
In the United States, for example, where professional licensure for the engineering and surveying professions is regulated at the state level, graduation from an ABET-accredited program is almost universally required to validate the educational experience of applicants. In states where non-ABET graduates are permitted to be licensed, an additional four to eight years of work experience may be required.
Many jurisdictions require graduation from an ABET-accredited program as a minimum qualification for registration to practice because it signifies preparation for entry into the profession. For example,
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
requires applicants in computing to have graduated from an ABET-accredited program before they are eligible to sit for the Examination for Registration to Practice in Patent Cases.
To promote the global career mobility of technical professionals, we participate in a number of
Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA)
. Graduates of programs accredited by an agency that is a signatory to these MRAs may be recognized for the purposes of licensure, registration or certification.

Because such recognition:
Demonstrates your competency, qualification and expertise in professional practice.
Shows your commitment to understanding professional, ethical and societal responsibilities.
Emphasizes the protection of the public health, safety and welfare within society.
Licensure and certification, however, differ in terms of legal status.
Licensure
refers to the demonstration of ability or knowledge required by law before being allowed to perform a task or job.
Certifications
earned from professional societies provide important opportunities for recognition of an individual’s professional knowledge and experience that are portable and that can provide feedback on the knowledge transfer that occurs within academic programs.
If you are interested in pursuing professional licensure, registration, and certifications, we encourage you to check out the following resources:

The National Society of Professional Engineers
(NSPE)
offers
information and resources
for licensed and soon-to-be licensed Professional Engineers.

The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES)
develops and administers the exams used for engineering and surveying licensure throughout the country. Exam requirements for each state, as well as information on how to become licensed, is available at
ncees.org
.
