With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

## [What is Accreditation?](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/what-is-accreditation/)

Accreditation is a review process to determine if educational programs meet defined standards of quality. Once achieved, accreditation is not permanent—it is renewed periodically to ensure that the quality of the educational program is maintained.
In the United States, academic accreditation is voluntary, decentralized, and carried out by many non-governmental, non-profit organizations. The process of academic accreditation typically culminates in an external quality review by a team of professional experts from academe or industry. These experts volunteer their time, professional knowledge, and experience to this process of quality assurance and ongoing improvement to education in their disciplines.
In other countries, accreditation may be required or governmental. The
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
provides information about accreditation and quality assurance in countries outside of the United States.

ABET accreditation is not a ranking system. It is a form of quality assurance for programs in the areas of applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. Our accreditation is recognized globally as evidence that a program meets the standards set by its technical profession.
We offer accreditation to
programs only
, not to degrees, departments, colleges, institutions, or individuals.
ABET is a federation of
member professional and technical societies
. These societies and their individual members collaborate through ABET to develop standards of quality, known as ABET Criteria, on which our review teams base their evaluations of programs under consideration for accreditation.

The accreditation process typically takes 18 months to complete. Programs new to ABET accreditation begin with a formal request for a review.
