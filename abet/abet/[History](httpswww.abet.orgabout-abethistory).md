At ABET, our approach, the standards we set and the quality we guarantee, inspires confidence in those who aim to build a better world — one that is safer, more efficient, more comfortable and more sustainable.
We accredit college and university programs in the disciplines of applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology at the associate, bachelor’s and master’s degree levels.
Did you know?
ABET originally stood for the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, but since 2005, we have operated exclusively under the acronym to reflect the broader range of disciplines we assure for quality.

With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

## [History](https://www.abet.org/about-abet/history/)

We were founded in 1932 as the Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), an engineering professional body dedicated to the education, accreditation, regulation and professional development of engineering professionals and students in the United States.
At its founding, ECPD was headquartered in New York City, first at the Engineering Societies Building and then the United Engineering Center. We relocated to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1996.
A New Name And Expanded Focus
In 1980, ECPD was renamed the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) to more accurately describe our emphasis on accreditation.
In response to the anticipated boom in computer science education, ABET helped establish the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (now called CSAB) in 1985. At its merger with ABET in the early 2000s, CSAB became one of our largest member societies, with more than 300 accredited programs.
In 2005, we began operating and doing business under the
acronym ABET
(ABET, pronounced “A-bet”), using “Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc.” as our corporate name only when required by law.
As the world’s leading accreditation body for programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology. ABET’s scope has grown beyond its original engineering and technology focus. Our community now includes educators, industry leaders, government officials and students from diverse disciplines.
For this reason, the organization is now exclusively referred to as ABET, reflecting our broad and inclusive mission to assure quality and stimulate innovation in technical education globally.
Licensure
From the very start, our educational standards have served as the basis of quality against which professional engineers are held for licensure. After over 80 years of refining our processes, programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) remain the benchmark for the engineering professions.
Our Policy on Licensure >
Member Societies
From the start, our activities were driven by the professions we serve. Today, 34
member societies
provide experts and set the standards for the ABET accreditation process. In 1932, seven engineering societies founded the organization and contributed to ECPD’s original direction and focus:
American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, now the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME)
American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE)
Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, now the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)
National Council of State Boards of Engineering Examiners (now NCEES)
In 1936, ECPD evaluated its first engineering degree programs. Ten years later, the council began evaluating engineering technology degree programs. By 1947, ECPD had accredited 580 undergraduate engineering programs at 133 institutions.
Producing guidance and training publications was a large part of ECPD operations. The council produced dozens of books, pamphlets, brochures, and movies—among them:
Reading List for Junior Engineers (1945)
Speaking Can be Easy… for Engineers Too (1950)
WOMENGINEER (1974)
Minorities in Engineering (1974)

Our international activities began in 1979, when ECPD signed its first
Mutual Recognition Agreement
with the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board. By the early 1990s, we served as consultants to both fledgling and established international accreditation boards, a substantial equivalence evaluator of international programs and a founding member of the multinational Washington Accord.
Engineering Criteria 2000 and Program Innovation
In 1997, following nearly a decade of development, we adopted Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000), considered at the time a revolutionary approach to accreditation criteria. EC2000 focused on outcomes (what is learned) rather than what is taught. At its core, EC2000 affirmed the importance of institutions establishing clear objectives and assessment processes to ensure that each program provides graduates with the technical and professional skills employers demand.
By eliminating the inflexibility of earlier accreditation criteria, EC2000 allowed us to empower program innovation rather than stifling it, as well as encourage new assessment processes and subsequent program improvement.
Today, the spirit of EC2000 can be found in the evaluation criteria of all our disciplines, and studies like
Penn State’s Engineering Change
prove those criteria are having a positive impact on ABET-accredited programs and graduates who have such essential 21st century skills as the ability to work in teams and communicate effectively.
We continue to work globally to promote the EC2000 perspective with other accreditation boards and in other degree program areas. We also promote global education and career mobility through
Mutual Recognition Agreements
, such as the Washington Accord, the Seoul Accord, the Sydney Accord and the Dublin Accord.
ABET Today
Currently, we accredit 4,773 programs at 930 colleges and universities in 42 countries. Each year, over 2,200 volunteers from 34 member societies contribute to ABET’s goal of assuring confidence in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology education, serving as program evaluators, committee and council members, commissioners and members of our Board of Directors.

# [Accreditation](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/)

We are a nonprofit, non-governmental agency that accredits programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology.
ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession for which that program prepares graduates.
We accredit programs, not institutions. We provide specialized accreditation for post-secondary programs within degree-granting institutions already recognized by national or regional institutional accreditation agencies or national education authorities worldwide.
Our accreditation is voluntary, and to date, 4,773 programs at 930 colleges and universities in 42 countries have received ABET accreditation. Over 200,000 students graduate from ABET-accredited programs each year, and millions of graduates have received degrees from ABET-accredited programs since 1932.

ABET accreditation is ISO 9001:2015 certified, making us one of only two accrediting agencies in the U.S., and one of the few worldwide, to receive this distinction.

The ABET Accreditation process is carried out by our four
accreditation commissions
. Each commission sets accreditation standards for specific program areas and degree levels. For more information about the commissions, including the differences between Engineering and Engineering Technology, please visit
