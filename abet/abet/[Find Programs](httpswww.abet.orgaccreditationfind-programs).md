With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.

We evaluate programs that use a variety of delivery methods: on-site instruction, online instruction, and those having components of both methods. The programs are evaluated against the same criteria regardless of delivery method.
What is an Online Program?
Many academic programs in higher education have at least some content offered online, including individual courses, homework assignments, and class research projects. What constitutes an “online” program is not always well-defined. In addition, the percentage of online content for any academic program changes frequently.
When ABET categorizes a program as “100% online”, it means that it is possible to meet the requirements to graduate from a program while receiving all course content in an online manner.
