With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

Sustainable Education: Readying Today’s Higher Ed Students to Tackle the World’s Grand Challenges
Advancing sustainable solutions to the world’s most pressing environmental challenges will take more than technical skills. Students of higher education, especially those in STEM fields, need diverse and global perspectives to understand—and address—long-standing problems in new ways.
Engineering Change: Lessons from Leaders on Modernizing Higher Education Engineering Curriculum >
This issue brief examines the evolution of engineering programs in colleges and universities across the country and how they are experiencing an epic revitalization—blurring the lines between class and career, and increasing access to dynamic, hands-on learning and projects—to keep pace with the rapid change of industry. It offers a brief glimpse into the best practices for driving change within engineering programs, and the benefits that have been realized.
ABET Accreditation: Into Natural Science >
This issue brief explores the value of ABET accreditation, and, specifically, the value that it could bring to natural science programs, including mathematics. It also presents industry perspectives from the companies that rely on graduates from those programs to populate their workforce. It then explains why ABET is in a strong position to meet the needs of fields and disciplines that would be new to ABET by drawing on the recently successful expansion into the accreditation of construction management programs.
