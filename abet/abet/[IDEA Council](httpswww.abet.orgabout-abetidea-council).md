With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

The IDEA Council works closely with our constituencies and advises our Board of Directors, ensuring that every update aligns with and strengthens the
ABET value position statement
.
In support of this statement, we offer the following clarifications and additional insights:
ABET is intentional and proactive in its practices to respect, support, and value individuals’ dignity and contribution.
We recognize the importance and value of having a large range of human differences, encompassing the characteristics that make one individual or group different from another.
We foster environments and spaces that are by design, construction, development, and information and communication technology supportive of engagement for all people, including people with disabilities, to fully and independently contribute.
We are fair, provide access and opportunities for the advancement of all people.

Approved by the ABET Board of Directors
ABET is committed to IDEA within ABET, its activities, its volunteer base, staff, operations and its accredited programs. To advance this commitment, ABET adopted the concept of a dynamic framework (i.e., evolving, living document) that outlines a set of recommended goals and examples of suggested strategies, along with potential metric areas to facilitate measurement of progress and assignment of accountability for ensuring that inclusive, diverse, equitable and accessible strategies are implemented, and goals are achieved. The overarching goal across all areas is to ensure representation, fairness, participation, and engagement across ABET.

On March 31, 2021, we received a letter of support from the Big 10+ Universities Deans of Engineering regarding the incorporation of diversity, equity and inclusion principles into ABET’s General Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs.

2021 ABET Symposium IDEA Session Recordings

Barriers to Implementing IDE in the Workplace: Raising Awareness of Educators and Students
Panelists discuss existing and emerging issues that are, or may become, barriers to the implementation of IDEA in the workplace environment, as well as approaches to raise awareness of such challenges in preparing graduates to enter the workforce.

Encouraging the Retention of Women in Engineering
Despite the increasing efforts to keep young women interested in STEM before college, once there, a sizeable number of them will still end up leaving engineering majors for non-STEM related fields. This session discusses a variety of possible approaches for the retention of women in engineering and explores the outcomes and impact of those programs.

Evolving Global IDE Landscape in the Workplace and Workforce: Impact on Student Preparation
Panelists describe the developing landscape with respect to IDEA in the workplace and workforce in their regions of the world, as well as educational responses to a changing workplace environment.
