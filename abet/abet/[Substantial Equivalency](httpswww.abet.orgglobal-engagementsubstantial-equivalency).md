With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.

Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.

## [Substantial Equivalency](https://www.abet.org/global-engagement/substantial-equivalency/)

Accreditation Outside of the United States
Some of the programs that are recognized as substantially equivalent, have now been accredited. Please see our Accredited Program Search for a complete list of ABET accredited programs.

In the past, ABET evaluated programs outside the U.S., by institutional request, to determine if they were “substantially equivalent” to ABET-accredited programs.
“Substantial equivalency” means that a program is comparable in program content and educational experience, but may differ in format or method of delivery. It implies reasonable confidence that the program has prepared its graduates to begin professional practice at the entry level. While these evaluations followed policies and procedures similar to those used for accreditation, no accreditation action was taken, nor was there any assumption that a program undergoing accreditation would be accredited as a result of such review.
Substantial equivalency is not binding on colleges, universities, employers, or licensing agencies. Most of the programs that were recognized as substantially equivalent have now been accredited.
