With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

Updated May 19, 2023

As of May 17, 2023, the ABET Board of Directors has now confirmed the end of ABET’s requirement for volunteers to be fully vaccinated when travelling on behalf of ABET. This is consistent with the White House announcement declaring the end of the vaccine requirement for federal employees, contractors and international air travelers and the declared end of the COVID-19 public health emergency.
ABET continues to recommend that all volunteers and staff on ABET business travel, regardless of the visit location, follow the CDC guidelines and comply with local requirements at the travel destination and the visit institution. ABET will continue to monitor all visit all locations for security, health, and safety risks in partnership with Global Rescue as we return to in-person reviews this cycle. Our priority continues to be the well-being, health, and safety of our volunteers and, if at any point a heightened risk makes it unsafe to send a team to a location, we will pivot to a virtual review.
Please do not hesitate to reach out to
accreditation@abet.org
with any questions about program delivery or planning for an upcoming review.

ABET has been monitoring the evolving situation related to the coronavirus COVID-19 as we prepare for the upcoming 2022-2023 Review Cycle activities. ABET’s top priority is the well-being, health and security of the institution’s administrators, faculty, staff and students, as well as the ABET team members. Our intention is to conduct reviews on site unless conditions are unsafe to send a team to the institution.
In consultation with Global Rescue as our trusted partner in providing reliable risk assessment and in conjunction with CDC travel advisories and the U.S. State Department, we have reached a determination regarding where we will send a team to campus and where we will conduct the review virtually.
It was important to decide early in the accreditation cycle to provide certainty for the volunteers as we assign the teams between late March and early June. In addition, it was important to provide certainty for the institutions to minimize disruption in their planning for the accreditation review.
ABET staff will continue to monitor Global Rescue’s weekly COVID-19 updates regarding the risk associated with travel to institutions that are designated for onsite reviews between now and the date of the review.
In the event of new pandemic conditions increasing risk, ABET may transition any remaining onsite visits to virtual reviews. Once a review is designated as a virtual review it will remain virtual for the remainder of the cycle, even if conditions change again.
As part of ABET’s COVID-19 policy, ABET requires that any individuals traveling on ABET business comply with all requirements established by the institution such as vaccinations, testing or masks.
All programs under review in the 2022-2023 accreditation cycle have received notification regarding whether their review will be conducted virtually or on site.
Please do not hesitate to reach out to
accreditation@abet.org
with any questions about program delivery or planning for an upcoming review.

We understand that universities and colleges continue to deal with unprecedented changes to their operations and budgets as they work to reallocate resources and continue to educate students. In light of these challenges, we are reducing maintenance fees for the 2021-2022 accreditation cycle by $50 USD per accredited program.
Adjustments to fees will be reflected in the next invoice.
