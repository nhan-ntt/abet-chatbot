With ABET accreditation, students, employers and the society we serve can be confident that a program meets the quality standards that produce graduates prepared to enter a global workforce.
We began as the educational standard against which professional engineers in the United States were held for licensure. Today, after more than 80 years, our standards continue to play this fundamental role and have become the basis of quality for STEM disciplines all over the world.
Developed by technical professionals from ABET’s member societies, our criteria focus on what students experience and learn. Sought worldwide, ABET’s voluntary peer-review process is highly respected because it adds critical value to academic programs in the technical disciplines, where quality, precision and safety are of the utmost importance.
Our more than 2,200 experts come from industry, academia and government. They give their time and effort supporting quality assurance activities around the world by serving as Program Evaluators, commissioners, board members and advisors.
ABET is a nonprofit, non-governmental organization with
ISO 9001:2015 certification

## [At A Glance](https://www.abet.org/about-abet/at-a-glance/)

Originally founded in 1932 as the Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), in 1980, we became the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology to more accurately describe the emphasis on accreditation. In 2005, to reflect our expanded scope, we began using the acronym ABET only.
Global Experts
The very professionals we serve drive our actions. Our 34
member societies
provide the Experts who develop our criteria, setting the standards for our accreditation process.
Outcomes-Based Accreditation
In 1997, following nearly a decade of development, we adopted Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000), considered at the time a revolutionary approach to accreditation criteria. EC2000 focused on learning outcomes (what students learn) rather than what is taught. By implementing such fundamental changes, ABET moved away from a rigid process orientation toward a set of attributes professionals must possess to excel in fields of critical importance to society.
Who We Are—Program Evaluators
ABET would not exist without our ABET Experts—leaders from industry, academia and government dedicated to contributing to their professions. We rely on our Experts to evaluate program materials, visit campuses and participate in accreditation decisions.
Today
We currently accredit 4,773 programs at 930 colleges and universities in 42 countries. Each year, 2,200 experts from 34 member societies contribute to ABET’s goal of assuring confidence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.
