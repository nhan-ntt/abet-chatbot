Polymorphism-aware models
Use population data to improve inferences.

**Po**lymorphism-aware phylogenetic **Mo**dels (PoMo) improve phylogenetic
inference using population data (site frequency data). Thereby they builds on
top of DNA substitution models and naturally account for incomplete lineage
sorting. In order to run PoMo, you need more sequences per species/population
(ideally five or more chromosomes per species/population) so that information
about the site frequency spectrum is available.

Currently this model is only available in the beta version 1.6. Please download it from here:

### Substitution models

Different DNA substitution models can be selected with the `-m`
option.  E.g., to select the GTR model, run IQ-TREE with:

    iqtree -s example.cf -m GTR+P
