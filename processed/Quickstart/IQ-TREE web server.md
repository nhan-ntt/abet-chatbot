### IQ-TREE web server

The quickest is to try out the [IQ-TREE web server](http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at), where you only need to upload an alignment, choose the options and start the analysis. There is a [web server tutorial here](Web-Server-Tutorial). 

If you want to use the command-line version, follow the instructions below.
