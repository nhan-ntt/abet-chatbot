### How do I report a bug?

For bug report, please send the following information to the [IQ-TREE Google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/iqtree):

1. A description of the behaviour, which you think might be unexpected or caused by a bug. 
2. The first 10 lines and last 10 lines of the `.log` file.
3. (If possible) the assertion message printed on the screen, which may look like this:

        iqtree: ....cpp:140: ...: Assertion '...' failed.
 
The development team will get back to you and may ask for the full `.log` file and input data files for debugging purpose, if necessary. In such case please **only send your data files directly to the developers for confidential reason**! Keep in mind that everyone can see all emails sent to the group!
