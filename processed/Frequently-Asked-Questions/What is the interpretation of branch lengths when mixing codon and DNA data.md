### What is the interpretation of branch lengths when mixing codon and DNA data?

When mixing codon and DNA data in a partitioned analysis, the branch lengths are interpreted as the number of nucleotide substitutions per nucleotide site! This is different from having only codon data, where branch lengths are the number of nucleotide substitutions per codon site (thus typically 3 times longer than under DNA models).

Note that if you mix codon, DNA and protein data, the branch lengths are then the number of character substitutions per site, where character is either nucleotide or amino-acid.
