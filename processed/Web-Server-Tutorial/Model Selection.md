Web server tutorial
A quick starting guide for the IQ-TREE Web Server.

This tutorial explains briefly how to use the IQ-TREE web server for fast online phylogenetic inference, accessible at <a target="_blank" href="http://iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at"> <b>iqtree.cibiv.univie.ac.at</b></a>.

There are three tabs: [Tree Inference](#tree-inference), [Model Selection](#model-selection) and [Analysis Results](#analysis-results).

### Model Selection

IQ-TREE supports a wide range of substitution models for DNA, protein, codon, binary and morphological alignments. In case you do not know which model is appropriate for your data, IQ-TREE can automatically determine the best-fit model for your alignment. Use the Model Selection tab if you only want to find the best-fit model without doing tree reconstruction.

Like with [Tree Inference](#tree-inference), the only obligatory input is a multiple sequence alignment. You can either upload your own **alignment file** or use the **example alignment** to try out the web server and then **submit the job**.
