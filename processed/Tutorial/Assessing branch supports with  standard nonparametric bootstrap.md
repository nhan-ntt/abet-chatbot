Beginner's tutorial
This tutorial gives a beginner's guide. 

Please first [download](http://www.iqtree.org/#download) and [install](Quickstart) the binary
for your platform. For the next steps, the folder containing your  `iqtree` executable should be added to your PATH enviroment variable so that IQ-TREE can be invoked by simply entering `iqtree` at the command-line. Alternatively, you can also copy `iqtree` binary into your system search.
TIP: For quick overview of all supported options in IQ-TREE, run the command  `iqtree -h`.

### Assessing branch supports with  standard nonparametric bootstrap

The standard nonparametric bootstrap is invoked by  the  `-b` option:

    iqtree -s example.phy -m TIM2+I+G -b 100

 `-b` specifies the number of bootstrap replicates where 100
is the minimum recommended number. The output files are similar to those produced by the UFBoot procedure.
