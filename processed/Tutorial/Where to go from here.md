Beginner's tutorial
This tutorial gives a beginner's guide. 

Please first [download](http://www.iqtree.org/#download) and [install](Quickstart) the binary
for your platform. For the next steps, the folder containing your  `iqtree` executable should be added to your PATH enviroment variable so that IQ-TREE can be invoked by simply entering `iqtree` at the command-line. Alternatively, you can also copy `iqtree` binary into your system search.
TIP: For quick overview of all supported options in IQ-TREE, run the command  `iqtree -h`.

### Where to go from here?

Once confident enough you can go on with a **[more advanced tutorial](Advanced-Tutorial)**, which covers topics like phylogenomic (multi-gene) analyses using partition models or mixture models.
