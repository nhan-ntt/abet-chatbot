Introduction

### Why IQ-TREE?

Thanks to the recent advent of next-generation sequencing techniques, the amount of phylogenomic/transcriptomic data have been rapidly accumulated. This extremely facilitates resolving many "deep phylogenetic" questions in the tree of life. At the same time it poses major computational challenges to analyze such big data, where most phylogenetic software cannot handle. Moreover, there is a need to develop more complex probabilistic models to adequately capture realistic aspects of genomic sequence evolution.

This trends motivated us to develop the IQ-TREE software with a strong emphasis on phylogenomic inference. Our goals are:

* __Accuracy__: Proposing novel computational methods that perform better than existing approaches.
* __Speed__: Allowing fast analysis on big data sets and utilizing high performance computing platforms.
* __Flexibility__: Facilitating the inclusion of new (phylogenomic) models and sequence data types.
* __Versatility__: Implementing a broad range of commonly-used maximum likelihood analyses.

IQ-TREE has been developed since 2011 and freely available at <http://www.iqtree.org/> as open-source software under the [GNU-GPL license version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html). It is actively maintained by the core development team (see below) and a number of collabrators.

The name IQ-TREE comes from the fact that it is the successor of [**IQ**PNNI](http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqpnni/) and [**TREE**-PUZZLE](http://www.tree-puzzle.de/) software.
