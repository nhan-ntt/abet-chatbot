## [At A Glance](https://www.abet.org/about-abet/at-a-glance/)

Originally founded in 1932 as the Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), in 1980, we became the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology to more accurately describe the emphasis on accreditation. In 2005, to reflect our expanded scope, we began using the acronym ABET only.
Global Experts
The very professionals we serve drive our actions. Our 34
member societies
provide the Experts who develop our criteria, setting the standards for our accreditation process.
Outcomes-Based Accreditation
In 1997, following nearly a decade of development, we adopted Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000), considered at the time a revolutionary approach to accreditation criteria. EC2000 focused on learning outcomes (what students learn) rather than what is taught. By implementing such fundamental changes, ABET moved away from a rigid process orientation toward a set of attributes professionals must possess to excel in fields of critical importance to society.
Who We Are—Program Evaluators
ABET would not exist without our ABET Experts—leaders from industry, academia and government dedicated to contributing to their professions. We rely on our Experts to evaluate program materials, visit campuses and participate in accreditation decisions.
Today
We currently accredit 4,773 programs at 930 colleges and universities in 42 countries. Each year, 2,200 experts from 34 member societies contribute to ABET’s goal of assuring confidence in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.

Goal 1:
Broaden engagement globally.
Goal 2:
Grow and enhance membership to support ABET activities.
Goal 3:
Continue expansion of Professional Programs.

Our approach, the standards we set and the quality we guarantee, inspires confidence in those who aim to build a better world – one that is safer, more efficient, more inclusive and more sustainable.

## [Governance](https://www.abet.org/about-abet/governance/)

ABET membership is comprised of
34 societies
, professional and technical organizations that represent the various fields we accredit in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology.
These societies join us because they see the value of reviewing and accrediting programs in their respective disciplines. That is why they collaborate to improve our general criteria, create specialized program criteria and recruit our pool of experts.

The ABET
Board of Directors
is the governing body responsible for strategic planning, financial oversight and managing the external relationships of our organization. It is also the final review body for appeal of decisions regarding accreditation actions for a specific program.
Our Board of Directors is comprised of 13 members: a President, President-Elect, Past-President, Secretary, Treasurer, four Area Directors, two At-Large Directors, one Public Director and the Executive Director/CEO (non-voting).
The Board of Directors is advised by four board-level councils—Academic, Industry, Global and Inclusion, Diversity and Equity.

The ABET
Board of Delegates
is responsible for approving accreditation policies and procedures, general criteria and the organization of our accreditation commissions.
Our Board of Delegates is comprised of 1-3 representatives from each of ABET’s 34 member societies. The number of seats on the Board of Delegates is determined by the number of accredited programs for which the society is responsible. The President-Elect serves as a non-voting Chair of the Board of Delegates.
The Board of Delegates is advised by one board-level council—Accreditation.

The four Area Delegations, which are aligned with the curricular areas of our commissions, are responsible for approving program-specific accreditation criteria and selecting members of the accreditation commissions, as well as assigning programs to member societies within their areas.
Seats on each Area Delegation are apportioned based on the number of accredited programs for which a society serves as “lead” within the relevant accreditation commission.
Each Area Delegation is responsible for selecting an Area Director to serve on the ABET Board of Directors. The individuals selected also serve as non-voting chairs of their respective Delegations.

Our accreditation activities are led by four
accreditation commissions
. These commissions are responsible for reviewing educational programs and making the final accreditation decision for each program.
Each commission is led by an executive committee that includes a chair, chair-elect, past-chair, vice chair of operations and members-at-large.
Each member society is entitled to have at least one member on each commission that reviews programs in disciplines for which that member society has primary responsibility. In addition, some member societies do not have responsibilities for any programs but still have representatives on the commissions related to their interests. For example, the National Society of Professional Engineers nominates an individual to serve on the Engineering Accreditation Commission.
Each commission has a public commissioner, an individual who is not affiliated with the fields that ABET accredits through either practice or training.
Each of the four Area Delegation Directors serves as a liaison between their respective commission and the Board of Directors.
The four commissions include:
Applied and Natural Science Accreditation Commission (ANSAC)
Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC)
Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC)
Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC)


## [Licensure, Registration &Certification](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/what-is-accreditation/licensure-registration-certification/)

Graduates of ABET-accredited programs who work in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology can seek professional recognition by enhancing their credentials through licensure, registration and certification programs where appropriate. Graduation from an ABET-accredited program is increasingly a required minimum credential for such professional recognition.

ABET does not provide licensure, registration or certification services for individuals. However, throughout our history, we have contributed significantly to the education of students who later seek official recognition of their qualifications to serve the public.
In the United States, for example, where professional licensure for the engineering and surveying professions is regulated at the state level, graduation from an ABET-accredited program is almost universally required to validate the educational experience of applicants. In states where non-ABET graduates are permitted to be licensed, an additional four to eight years of work experience may be required.
Many jurisdictions require graduation from an ABET-accredited program as a minimum qualification for registration to practice because it signifies preparation for entry into the profession. For example,
United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)
requires applicants in computing to have graduated from an ABET-accredited program before they are eligible to sit for the Examination for Registration to Practice in Patent Cases.
To promote the global career mobility of technical professionals, we participate in a number of
Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRA)
. Graduates of programs accredited by an agency that is a signatory to these MRAs may be recognized for the purposes of licensure, registration or certification.

Because such recognition:
Demonstrates your competency, qualification and expertise in professional practice.
Shows your commitment to understanding professional, ethical and societal responsibilities.
Emphasizes the protection of the public health, safety and welfare within society.
Licensure and certification, however, differ in terms of legal status.
Licensure
refers to the demonstration of ability or knowledge required by law before being allowed to perform a task or job.
Certifications
earned from professional societies provide important opportunities for recognition of an individual’s professional knowledge and experience that are portable and that can provide feedback on the knowledge transfer that occurs within academic programs.
If you are interested in pursuing professional licensure, registration, and certifications, we encourage you to check out the following resources:

The National Society of Professional Engineers
(NSPE)
offers
information and resources
for licensed and soon-to-be licensed Professional Engineers.

## [History](https://www.abet.org/about-abet/history/)

We were founded in 1932 as the Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), an engineering professional body dedicated to the education, accreditation, regulation and professional development of engineering professionals and students in the United States.
At its founding, ECPD was headquartered in New York City, first at the Engineering Societies Building and then the United Engineering Center. We relocated to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1996.
A New Name And Expanded Focus
In 1980, ECPD was renamed the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) to more accurately describe our emphasis on accreditation.
In response to the anticipated boom in computer science education, ABET helped establish the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (now called CSAB) in 1985. At its merger with ABET in the early 2000s, CSAB became one of our largest member societies, with more than 300 accredited programs.
In 2005, we began operating and doing business under the
acronym ABET
(ABET, pronounced “A-bet”), using “Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Inc.” as our corporate name only when required by law.
As the world’s leading accreditation body for programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology. ABET’s scope has grown beyond its original engineering and technology focus. Our community now includes educators, industry leaders, government officials and students from diverse disciplines.
For this reason, the organization is now exclusively referred to as ABET, reflecting our broad and inclusive mission to assure quality and stimulate innovation in technical education globally.
Licensure
From the very start, our educational standards have served as the basis of quality against which professional engineers are held for licensure. After over 80 years of refining our processes, programs accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) remain the benchmark for the engineering professions.
Our Policy on Licensure >
Member Societies
From the start, our activities were driven by the professions we serve. Today, 34
member societies
provide experts and set the standards for the ABET accreditation process. In 1932, seven engineering societies founded the organization and contributed to ECPD’s original direction and focus:
American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)
American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers, now the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers (AIME)
American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME)
American Institute of Electrical Engineers (now IEEE)
Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education, now the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE)
National Council of State Boards of Engineering Examiners (now NCEES)
In 1936, ECPD evaluated its first engineering degree programs. Ten years later, the council began evaluating engineering technology degree programs. By 1947, ECPD had accredited 580 undergraduate engineering programs at 133 institutions.
Producing guidance and training publications was a large part of ECPD operations. The council produced dozens of books, pamphlets, brochures, and movies—among them:
Reading List for Junior Engineers (1945)
Speaking Can be Easy… for Engineers Too (1950)
WOMENGINEER (1974)
Minorities in Engineering (1974)

Our international activities began in 1979, when ECPD signed its first
Mutual Recognition Agreement
with the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board. By the early 1990s, we served as consultants to both fledgling and established international accreditation boards, a substantial equivalence evaluator of international programs and a founding member of the multinational Washington Accord.
Engineering Criteria 2000 and Program Innovation
In 1997, following nearly a decade of development, we adopted Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000), considered at the time a revolutionary approach to accreditation criteria. EC2000 focused on outcomes (what is learned) rather than what is taught. At its core, EC2000 affirmed the importance of institutions establishing clear objectives and assessment processes to ensure that each program provides graduates with the technical and professional skills employers demand.
By eliminating the inflexibility of earlier accreditation criteria, EC2000 allowed us to empower program innovation rather than stifling it, as well as encourage new assessment processes and subsequent program improvement.
Today, the spirit of EC2000 can be found in the evaluation criteria of all our disciplines, and studies like
Penn State’s Engineering Change
prove those criteria are having a positive impact on ABET-accredited programs and graduates who have such essential 21st century skills as the ability to work in teams and communicate effectively.
We continue to work globally to promote the EC2000 perspective with other accreditation boards and in other degree program areas. We also promote global education and career mobility through
Mutual Recognition Agreements
, such as the Washington Accord, the Seoul Accord, the Sydney Accord and the Dublin Accord.
ABET Today
Currently, we accredit 4,773 programs at 930 colleges and universities in 42 countries. Each year, over 2,200 volunteers from 34 member societies contribute to ABET’s goal of assuring confidence in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology education, serving as program evaluators, committee and council members, commissioners and members of our Board of Directors.

# [Accreditation](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/)

We are a nonprofit, non-governmental agency that accredits programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology.
ABET accreditation provides assurance that a college or university program meets the quality standards of the profession for which that program prepares graduates.
We accredit programs, not institutions. We provide specialized accreditation for post-secondary programs within degree-granting institutions already recognized by national or regional institutional accreditation agencies or national education authorities worldwide.
Our accreditation is voluntary, and to date, 4,773 programs at 930 colleges and universities in 42 countries have received ABET accreditation. Over 200,000 students graduate from ABET-accredited programs each year, and millions of graduates have received degrees from ABET-accredited programs since 1932.

ABET accreditation is ISO 9001:2015 certified, making us one of only two accrediting agencies in the U.S., and one of the few worldwide, to receive this distinction.

The ABET Accreditation process is carried out by our four
accreditation commissions
. Each commission sets accreditation standards for specific program areas and degree levels. For more information about the commissions, including the differences between Engineering and Engineering Technology, please visit
this page
.


## [What is Accreditation?](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/what-is-accreditation/)

Accreditation is a review process to determine if educational programs meet defined standards of quality. Once achieved, accreditation is not permanent—it is renewed periodically to ensure that the quality of the educational program is maintained.
In the United States, academic accreditation is voluntary, decentralized, and carried out by many non-governmental, non-profit organizations. The process of academic accreditation typically culminates in an external quality review by a team of professional experts from academe or industry. These experts volunteer their time, professional knowledge, and experience to this process of quality assurance and ongoing improvement to education in their disciplines.
In other countries, accreditation may be required or governmental. The
United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
provides information about accreditation and quality assurance in countries outside of the United States.

ABET accreditation is not a ranking system. It is a form of quality assurance for programs in the areas of applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology. Our accreditation is recognized globally as evidence that a program meets the standards set by its technical profession.
We offer accreditation to
programs only
, not to degrees, departments, colleges, institutions, or individuals.
ABET is a federation of
member professional and technical societies
. These societies and their individual members collaborate through ABET to develop standards of quality, known as ABET Criteria, on which our review teams base their evaluations of programs under consideration for accreditation.

The accreditation process typically takes 18 months to complete. Programs new to ABET accreditation begin with a formal request for a review.
Accreditation: Step-by-Step
offers a detailed overview of our accreditation process.
See
Eligibility Requirements
to determine if ABET accreditation is available for your program.
ABET accreditation requires compliance with the
criteria, policies, and procedures
upon which our review is based.
Information for Programs Seeking Initial Accreditation
answers many frequently-asked-questions for programs and institutions new to ABET accreditation.


## [Get Accredited](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/get-accredited/)

ABET accreditation is the culmination of a practice of ongoing self-assessment and continuous improvement, which assures confidence that ABET-accredited programs are meeting the needs of their students, preparing graduates to enter their careers, and responsive to the needs of the professions and the world. This process has to be initiated by the institution.
For a visual timeline of the accreditation process, see
Accreditation Step-by-Step
.
Beforehand – Assessment and Eligibility
Before seeking ABET accreditation, your program should determine if it falls into the categories that we accredit, and that it meets our
Eligibility Requirements
. Prior to seeking an accreditation review, each program must have a functioning
assessment process
in place that meets our
criteria
for accreditation in three areas: Program Educational Objectives, Student Outcomes, and Continuous Improvement.

## [Find Programs](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/find-programs/)

The easiest way to find an accredited program is to use our
ABET-Accredited Program Search tool
. Below you will find more information regarding online programs and more.
Search Programs

We evaluate programs that use a variety of delivery methods: on-site instruction, online instruction, and those having components of both methods. The programs are evaluated against the same criteria regardless of delivery method.
What is an Online Program?
Many academic programs in higher education have at least some content offered online, including individual courses, homework assignments, and class research projects. What constitutes an “online” program is not always well-defined. In addition, the percentage of online content for any academic program changes frequently.
When ABET categorizes a program as “100% online”, it means that it is possible to meet the requirements to graduate from a program while receiving all course content in an online manner.

## [COVID-19 Updates](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/covid-19-update/)

ABET continues to monitor the evolving situation related to the coronavirus COVID-19. We know individuals and institutions continue to be under tremendous stress in these uncertain times, and the full impact of this global health crisis still remains to be seen. As we navigate these challenges together, please be assured that we are committed to supporting our common goal of ensuring our world’s sustainability, safety, health and well-being.
Below, you’ll find several announcements regarding this year’s accreditation cycle and upcoming ABET events and programs. Please check this page for additional updates as the situation evolves.
ABET volunteers: please log in to
MyABET
for additional information.
Updated May 19, 2023

As of May 17, 2023, the ABET Board of Directors has now confirmed the end of ABET’s requirement for volunteers to be fully vaccinated when travelling on behalf of ABET. This is consistent with the White House announcement declaring the end of the vaccine requirement for federal employees, contractors and international air travelers and the declared end of the COVID-19 public health emergency.
ABET continues to recommend that all volunteers and staff on ABET business travel, regardless of the visit location, follow the CDC guidelines and comply with local requirements at the travel destination and the visit institution. ABET will continue to monitor all visit all locations for security, health, and safety risks in partnership with Global Rescue as we return to in-person reviews this cycle. Our priority continues to be the well-being, health, and safety of our volunteers and, if at any point a heightened risk makes it unsafe to send a team to a location, we will pivot to a virtual review.
Please do not hesitate to reach out to
accreditation@abet.org
with any questions about program delivery or planning for an upcoming review.

ABET has been monitoring the evolving situation related to the coronavirus COVID-19 as we prepare for the upcoming 2022-2023 Review Cycle activities. ABET’s top priority is the well-being, health and security of the institution’s administrators, faculty, staff and students, as well as the ABET team members. Our intention is to conduct reviews on site unless conditions are unsafe to send a team to the institution.
In consultation with Global Rescue as our trusted partner in providing reliable risk assessment and in conjunction with CDC travel advisories and the U.S. State Department, we have reached a determination regarding where we will send a team to campus and where we will conduct the review virtually.
It was important to decide early in the accreditation cycle to provide certainty for the volunteers as we assign the teams between late March and early June. In addition, it was important to provide certainty for the institutions to minimize disruption in their planning for the accreditation review.
ABET staff will continue to monitor Global Rescue’s weekly COVID-19 updates regarding the risk associated with travel to institutions that are designated for onsite reviews between now and the date of the review.
In the event of new pandemic conditions increasing risk, ABET may transition any remaining onsite visits to virtual reviews. Once a review is designated as a virtual review it will remain virtual for the remainder of the cycle, even if conditions change again.
As part of ABET’s COVID-19 policy, ABET requires that any individuals traveling on ABET business comply with all requirements established by the institution such as vaccinations, testing or masks.
All programs under review in the 2022-2023 accreditation cycle have received notification regarding whether their review will be conducted virtually or on site.
Please do not hesitate to reach out to
accreditation@abet.org
with any questions about program delivery or planning for an upcoming review.

We understand that universities and colleges continue to deal with unprecedented changes to their operations and budgets as they work to reallocate resources and continue to educate students. In light of these challenges, we are reducing maintenance fees for the 2021-2022 accreditation cycle by $50 USD per accredited program.
Adjustments to fees will be reflected in the next invoice.
If you have specific questions about your program, please contact
accreditation@abet.org
.

We are temporarily unable to provide copies of
ECEI Credentials Evaluation Reports
. We appreciate your patience, and we will respond to all requests when the ABET headquarters office reopens.

Upcoming
Events and Workshops
may be postponed or offered as virtual events. We will make a determination about future events and send out notifications two weeks prior to the event so participants can make adjustments to their travel plans.

outside of the U.S.

Our international activities support our mission to assure confidence in the career preparation of professionals in applied & natural science, computing, engineering and engineering technology education programs worldwide.


## [Accreditation Outside the U.S.](https://www.abet.org/accreditation/get-accredited/accreditation-outside-the-u-s/)

ABET is engaged globally through four primary means: 1) accreditation of academic programs; 2) mutual recognition of accreditation organizations; 3) Memoranda of Understanding with accreditation/quality assurance organizations; and 4) engagement in global STEM education organizations.
We take an active role in the global quality assurance process for technical education programs through numerous agreements with organizations worldwide. These include Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) and Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs). A list of our MRA global partners can be found
here
and
here
. A list of our MOU global partners can be found
here
.
We respect the autonomy of each nation’s higher education quality assurance organization. While ABET accredits programs outside of the US, we also encourage all academic programs located in these countries and regions to pursue accreditation by the appropriate MRA or MOU partner. We will conduct an accreditation review in the MRA/MOU country/region only if our partner does not object.
In addition, programs located outside of the U.S. must have each appropriate education authority, recognition or accreditation agency complete a
Request for Acknowledgement form
to be submitted with the formal Request for Evaluation. We will conduct an accreditation review outside the U.S. only in cases where there is no objection from all applicable education authorities or recognition/accreditation agencies in that program’s country or region.
The ABET accreditation process for programs located outside of the U.S.
is identical to the accreditation process for programs within the U.S.

For detail on accreditation costs, see the
Fee Schedule for programs outside the U.S.
We encourage you to pay close attention to these fees in particular:
Reimbursement of the ABET team’s actual travel expenses – Travel expenses include but are not limited to roundtrip airfare, lodging, transportation, meals, international calls, visa costs and travel insurance (both medical and security). Please note that ABET permits its volunteers to travel business class when international flights are equal to or greater than seven hours in total (layovers included).
Additional support for ensuring safety and security of the ABET team – This may include but is not limited to airport pick-up, escort and daily ground transportation between each of the visit locations (i.e. campuses, hotel and airport).
Expect to be invoiced for reimbursement of actual travel expenses generated by the ABET team after conclusion of the scheduled on-site visit.
Institutions that submit official Requests for Evaluation (RFEs) are responsible for complying with the ABET payment requirements.

A program seeking accreditation in a country where English is not the native language must provide its program name both in English and in the native language. English translation of a program name should be based on the technical content, not the literal translation of the program name, so that ABET can designate the appropriate accreditation commission(s) and determine the applicable criteria.
Official transcripts must be provided in English or come with a certified/official English translation.
The
self-study report
and other documents provided to the review team must be in English.
Programs must be able to prepare for and receive a visiting review team conducting activities in English. All visit activities will be conducted in English.

## [Mutual Recognition Agreements](https://www.abet.org/global-engagement/mutual-recognition-agreements/)

The mutual recognition of accrediting systems throughout the world supports our mission to improve technical education worldwide and foster the mobility of students and graduates.
Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs)
, often known as “accords,” are non-governmental agreements among organizations that accredit academic degree programs.
These agreements recognize the
substantial equivalency
of participating organizations’ accreditation processes and their graduates’ preparedness to begin professional practice at the entry level.
Substantial equivalency
means that the accreditation systems have comparable standards, outcomes, and processes, even though they may not be identical.
We are a signatory to five MRAs:
The multilateral
Seoul Accord
(for computing programs)
The
bilateral agreement between Engineers Canada and ABET
(for engineering programs)
The multilateral
Washington Accord
(for engineering programs)
The multilateral
Sydney Accord
(for bachelor degree-level engineering technology programs)
The multilateral
Dublin Accord
(for associate degree-level engineering technician programs)

Overview
In keeping with our vision “to provide world leadership” in encouraging the highest quality collegiate programs in applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology education, our Global Council (GC) establishes processes for mutual recognition of ABET-accredited programs in the United States and corresponding programs in other countries through
Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs)
.
The Global Council receives frequent requests from organizations outside the United States, seeking technical assistance in developing or gaining recognition for their accreditation systems. Our services to help higher education agencies or organizations outside the U.S. in developing quality assurance processes are formalized under
Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs)
. Often the underlying goal of these requests is to prepare an accrediting agency or higher education authority for entrance into an international MRA, such as the Seoul, Washington, Dublin, or Sydney accord.
What MRAs Recognize
MRAs (also known as “accords”) recognize the substantial equivalence of mature accreditation systems and programs accredited by signatory organizations within their jurisdictions. Signatories of MRAs agree that the graduates of programs accredited by the accord’s signatories are prepared to begin practice of the profession at the entry level.
Why We Engage in MRAs
We enter into MRAs with appropriate higher education agencies/organizations in other countries as a mechanism to promote the quality improvement of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology education around the world.
Joining in MRAs
Through our Global Council, we may enter into an MRA with recognized higher education authorities or quality assurance organizations outside of the United States. We also sponsor such organizations’ membership in the Washington Accord, Sydney Accord, Seoul Accord, and other accords to which we are a signatory, subject to the following conditions:
The organization has an on-going, profession-controlled, peer-review accreditation system for applied science, computing, engineering, or engineering technology degree programs at institutions of higher education within the country.
The organization has completed a minimum of five (5) accreditation cycles prior to their request for entry or sponsorship into the MRA.
The organization has received recognition, approval, and/or authorization of operating status from a national educational ministry, legislative mandate, or other appropriate authority (governmental or non-governmental).
The organization provides a mechanism whereby the professions related to the programs accredited have representation within its governance structure, and professional peers are involved in a voluntary manner in the accreditation process, including formulation of accreditation criteria, policies and procedures, and decisions about accreditation actions.
The organization has goals, objectives, criteria, policies, and procedures in educational quality assurance consistent with the practices we recognize.
The organization demonstrates a willingness to share studies, proposals, discussions, minutes of board/commission meetings, and accreditation policies and procedures; and, by mutual consent, agrees to participate as observers in meetings and site visits, and contribute to the understanding of other signatories’ systems of accreditation.
Each party to the MRA adjudges accreditation decisions by the other party to be acceptable and substantially equivalent based on evidence that graduates demonstrate acceptable educational preparation for entry into the practice of the discipline for which the program is being accredited.
The organization recognizes and agrees that ABET may enter into other MRAs with other entities within the same country or region when judged appropriate by ABET.
The MRA is in effect for a mutually agreeable finite period of time and includes an exit clause that allows either entity to withdraw from the agreement with appropriate written notice.
The MRA does not preclude ABET from accrediting a qualifying program if requested to do so by an institution, regardless of geographic location.
Procedures for Developing & Implementing MRAs
We follow the procedures below in developing and implementing MRAs:
The Global Council conducts a preliminary review and evaluation of a candidate organization’s accreditation system through exchange of pertinent documentation.
A positive outcome enables the Global Council to arrange for the exchange visit of appropriate representatives. A negative outcome terminates the review, unless the candidate requests ABET assistance in further development of its accreditation system.
The MRA must have appropriate procedures for on-site reviews of candidate organizations, and ABET reserves the right to participate in these reviews. The visits should include opportunities for interviews with appropriate authorities, observance of decision meetings, and allow an assessment of the cultural setting in which the system operates.
The reports of the review teams of candidate accrediting organizations are presented to the Global Council for consideration and approval. When a recommendation includes the possibility of establishing an MRA, a draft MRA document accompanies the recommendation from the Global Council. Any financial commitment related to the implementation of the MRA must be specified in writing. In addition, any manpower required to implement the MRA must also be specified on an annual basis.
Any evaluations or consultations to be undertaken as a result of an MRA will be completed in accordance with established ABET policies and procedures, insofar as possible. Due recognition is given to different economic, cultural, environmental, political, and societal factors, as well as purely technical/educational matters.

Learn More
Please contact our
Director of International Engagement and Governance
for more information about MRAs.


## [Memoranda of Understanding](https://www.abet.org/global-engagement/memoranda-of-understanding/)

We use Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and Letters of Intent (LOI) to formalize and structure our collaborative efforts with peer accrediting agencies outside the United States during their developmental period.
Unlike a
Mutual Recognition Agreement
, an MOU does not recognize the “substantial equivalency” of an organization’s accreditation processes or graduates’ preparedness to begin professional practice.
Activities through an MOU (or LOI) may include the sharing of best practices, assisting organizations in the development of accreditation processes, and providing training workshops for staff and volunteers of peer organizations.

Entering into Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with appropriate higher education agencies or organizations in other countries is one mechanism by which we promote continuing quality improvement of collegiate programs in applied and natural science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology education around the world.
The Global Council receives regular requests for to provide technical assistance to organizations outside the U.S. in developing or gaining recognition for their accreditation systems—through a wide range of activities including sharing our experience in the field of accreditation, general information on our policies and procedures, criteria development seminars, evaluator training, and observer visits. Such activities are formalized through
Memoranda of Understanding.

The Global Council (GC) also establishes processes for mutual recognition of ABET-accredited programs in the United States and corresponding programs in other countries through
Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs)
. We participate in MRAs including the Washington Accord, Sydney Accord, Dublin Accord, and Seoul Accord.
As a developing accreditation system matures, the controlling higher education agency or organization may elect to apply to participate in an existing multi-lateral Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) with other accrediting organizations.
An MRA is initiated outside the terms of the MOU, and the request to participate in an MRA is directly submitted from the agency to the appropriate accord secretariat. We may be asked to formally sponsor such an application, and mentor that accrediting agency through provisional status. However, the MOU does not bind us in any way to support such activities.

## [Substantial Equivalency](https://www.abet.org/global-engagement/substantial-equivalency/)

Accreditation Outside of the United States
Some of the programs that are recognized as substantially equivalent, have now been accredited. Please see our Accredited Program Search for a complete list of ABET accredited programs.

In the past, ABET evaluated programs outside the U.S., by institutional request, to determine if they were “substantially equivalent” to ABET-accredited programs.
“Substantial equivalency” means that a program is comparable in program content and educational experience, but may differ in format or method of delivery. It implies reasonable confidence that the program has prepared its graduates to begin professional practice at the entry level. While these evaluations followed policies and procedures similar to those used for accreditation, no accreditation action was taken, nor was there any assumption that a program undergoing accreditation would be accredited as a result of such review.
Substantial equivalency is not binding on colleges, universities, employers, or licensing agencies. Most of the programs that were recognized as substantially equivalent have now been accredited.
Please see our
Accredited Program Search
for a complete list of ABET-accredited programs.

Substantial equivalency is not binding on colleges, universities, employers, or licensing agencies.

The following programs are recognized by ABET as being substantially equivalent. Recognition is effective from October 1st to September 30th of the years indicated below.

# [Program Evaluators](https://www.abet.org/program-evaluators/)

ABET accreditation would not be possible without our ABET Experts — professionals from industry, academia and government dedicated to contributing to their professions through the ongoing improvement of the quality of technical education.
We rely on our experts to evaluate program materials, visit campuses and participate in accreditation decisions. Most begin their service as program evaluators, who do the hands-on work of accrediting 4,773 programs at 930 institutions in 42 countries. Those with the strongest leadership abilities are promoted into the ranks of the
commissions
, each serving as a team chair – responsible for leading teams of evaluators.
More than 2,200 dedicated STEM professionals
from academia, industry and government
form the heart of our peer-based accreditation services. These well-respected experts are the face of ABET, representing us at campuses around the world.

To meet the worldwide demand for ABET Accreditation, we are expanding the number of program evaluators.

Thousands of technical professionals give their time and expertise because they care deeply about the quality of technical education and believe the accreditation process enhances both individual programs and the professions.
There are many reasons to become a program evaluator. Read our
Spotlight
testimonials to learn more about the people who make ABET one of the leading accreditors in the world.
The experience of serving on a review team can be both personally and professionally rewarding because it offers opportunities to:
Help assure ABET accreditation criteria reflect contemporary practice and the expectations of the technical professions and their key constituents;
Gain insight into “best practices” and trends in technical education and the particular characteristics of individual schools and programs; and
Benefit from interaction and networking with committed peers beyond the usual boundaries of geography, sector and discipline.

Program Evaluator Candidate Training >
After completing the
ABET Program Evaluator Application
and being approved by one of our professional and technical societies, prospective program evaluators participate in Program Evaluator Candidate (PEVC) Training. This training is designed to simulate the actual ABET program review process. Successful completion of PEVC Training results in becoming an ABET program evaluator. The entire PEVC Training process consists of three separate steps:
Online pre-work
Simulated Visit Training
Society-specific training (if applicable)
The online portion of PEVC Training typically takes 20-25 hours and requires written work and the completion of three proficiency assessments. After the online training is complete, PEVCs then attend Simulated Visit Training, which is a facilitated experiential workshop that simulates an accreditation visit. The online training must be completed at least four weeks before Simulated Visit Training.
PEVCs who successfully complete both the online pre-work and Simulated Visit Training may then be approved by their member society to serve as a program evaluator. Some societies require
additional specialized training
, which is conducted separately.
The entire PEVC Training process begins in January and ends in June.
