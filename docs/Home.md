Introduction

### Why IQ-TREE?
Thanks to the recent advent of next-generation sequencing techniques, the amount of phylogenomic/transcriptomic data have been rapidly accumulated. This extremely facilitates resolving many "deep phylogenetic" questions in the tree of life. At the same time it poses major computational challenges to analyze such big data, where most phylogenetic software cannot handle. Moreover, there is a need to develop more complex probabilistic models to adequately capture realistic aspects of genomic sequence evolution.

This trends motivated us to develop the IQ-TREE software with a strong emphasis on phylogenomic inference. Our goals are:

* __Accuracy__: Proposing novel computational methods that perform better than existing approaches.
* __Speed__: Allowing fast analysis on big data sets and utilizing high performance computing platforms.
* __Flexibility__: Facilitating the inclusion of new (phylogenomic) models and sequence data types.
* __Versatility__: Implementing a broad range of commonly-used maximum likelihood analyses.

IQ-TREE has been developed since 2011 and freely available at <http://www.iqtree.org/> as open-source software under the [GNU-GPL license version 2](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html). It is actively maintained by the core development team (see below) and a number of collabrators.

The name IQ-TREE comes from the fact that it is the successor of [**IQ**PNNI](http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqpnni/) and [**TREE**-PUZZLE](http://www.tree-puzzle.de/) software.


### Key features

* __Efficient search algorithm__: Fast and effective stochastic algorithm to reconstruct phylogenetic trees by maximum likelihood. IQ-TREE compares favorably to RAxML and PhyML in terms of likelihood while requiring similar amount of computing time ([Nguyen et al., 2015]).
* __Ultrafast bootstrap__: An ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) to assess branch supports. UFBoot is 10 to 40 times faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap and obtains less biased support values ([Minh et al., 2013]; [Hoang et al., 2018]).
* __Ultrafast model selection__: An ultrafast and automatic model selection (ModelFinder) which is 10 to 100 times faster than jModelTest and ProtTest. ModelFinder also finds best-fit partitioning scheme like PartitionFinder ([Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017]).
* __Simulating sequences__: A fast sequence alignment simulator (AliSim) which is much more realistic than Seq-Gen and INDELible ([Ly-Trong et al., 2023]). 
* __Big Data Analysis__: Supporting huge datasets with thousands of sequences or millions of alignment sites via [checkpointing](Command-Reference#checkpointing-to-resume-stopped-run), safe numerical and low memory mode. [Multicore CPUs](Tutorial#utilizing-multi-core-cpus) and [parallel MPI system](Compilation-Guide#compiling-mpi-version) are utilized to speedup analysis.
* __Phylogenetic testing__: Several fast branch tests like SH-aLRT and aBayes test ([Anisimova et al., 2011]) and tree topology tests like the approximately unbiased (AU) test ([Shimodaira, 2002]).


The strength of IQ-TREE is the availability of a wide variety of phylogenetic models:

* __Common models__: All [common substitution models](Substitution-Models) for DNA, protein, codon, binary and morphological data with [rate heterogeneity among sites](Substitution-Models#rate-heterogeneity-across-sites) and [ascertainment bias correction](Substitution-Models#ascertainment-bias-correction) for e.g. SNP data.
* __[Partition models](Complex-Models#partition-models)__: Allowing individual models for different genomic loci (e.g. genes or codon positions), mixed data types, mixed rate heterogeneity types, linked or unlinked branch lengths between partitions.
* __Mixture models__: [fully customizable mixture models](Complex-Models#mixture-models) and [empirical protein mixture models](Substitution-Models#protein-mixture-models) and.
* __Polymorphism-aware models__: Accounting for *incomplete lineage sorting* to infer species tree from genome-wide population data ([Schrempf et al., 2016]).
