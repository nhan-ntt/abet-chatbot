Compilation guide
For advanced users to compile IQ-TREE source code.


### General requirements


* A C++ compiler such as GCC (version >= 4.8), Clang, MS Visual Studio and Intel C++ compiler. 

* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org) version >= 2.8.10.

* [Boost library](https://www.boost.org) for IQ-TREE version 2. Boost library is typically available under Linux. Under MacOS you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and run `brew install boost` to install the Boost library. By default IQ-TREE will detect the path to the installed Boost library. 

* [Eigen3 library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (for IQ-TREE version >= 1.6). Under MacOS you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and run `brew install eigen` to install the Boost library. By default IQ-TREE will  detect the path to the installed Eigen3 library. If this failed, you have to manually specify `-DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=<installed_eigen3_dir>` to the `cmake` command (see below).

* OpenMP library, which is used to compile the multicore version. This should typically be the case with `gcc` under Linux. Under MacOS you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and run `brew install libomp` to install the OpenMP library.

* (_Optional_) Install [git](https://git-scm.com) if you want to clone source code from [IQ-TREE GitHub repository](https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE).

### Downloading source code


Choose the source code (`zip` or `tar.gz`) of the IQ-TREE release you want to use from:

<https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2/releases>

For IQ-TREE version 1 please use:

<https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE/releases/>

Alternatively, if you have `git` installed, you can also clone the source code from GitHub with:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/iqtree/iqtree2.git

For IQ-TREE version 1 please clone:

    git clone https://github.com/Cibiv/IQ-TREE.git

Please find below separate compilation guide fors [Linux](#compiling-under-linux), [Mac OS X](#compiling-under-mac-os-x), and [Windows](#compiling-under-windows) as well as for [32-bit version](#compiling-32-bit-version) or for [MPI version](#compiling-mpi-version).

### Compiling under Linux


>**TIP**: Ready made IQ-TREE packages are provided for [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/iqtree) and [Arch Linux (AUR)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/iqtree-latest/).
{: .tip}

1. Open a Terminal.
2. Change to the source code folder:

        cd PATH_TO_EXTRACTED_SOURCE_CODE

3. Create a subfolder, say, `build` and go into this subfolder:

        mkdir build
        cd build

4. Configure source code with CMake:

        cmake ..

    If `cmake` failed with message about `Eigen3 not found`, then install Eigen3 library and run `cmake` again. If this still failed, you have to manually specify the downloaded directory of Eigen3 with:
    
        cmake -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=<eigen3_dir> ..
        

5. Compile source code with `make`:

        make -j
    
    `j` option tells it to use all CPU cores to speed up the compilation. Without this option, `make` uses only one core, which might be slow.
    
This creates an executable `iqtree2` (`iqtree` for version 1). It can be copied to your system search path so that IQ-TREE can be called from the Terminal simply with the command line `iqtree2`.

To compile IQ-TREE under Linux with ARM processor, use either GCC 10 (but not above), or Clang 14 or above.

>**TIP**: The above guide typically compiles IQ-TREE with `gcc`. If you have Clang installed and want to compile with Clang, the compilation will be similar to Mac OS X like below.
{: .tip}

### Compiling under Mac OS X


* Make sure that Clang compiler is installed, which is typically the case if you installed Xcode and the associated command line tools.

* If you installed cmake with Homebrew 

* Find the path to the CMake executable, which is typically `/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake`. For later convenience, please create a symbolic link `cmake` to this cmake executable, so that cmake can be invoked from the Terminal by simply entering `cmake`.

The steps to compile IQ-TREE are similar to Linux (see above), except that you need to specify `clang` as compiler when configuring source code with CMake (step 4):

    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ..

(please change `cmake` to absolute path like `/Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake`).

* To compile IQ-TREE under Mac with ARM processor, use Clang 17 or above.

* If the OpenMP include or lib files cannot be found, then you can specify the location of OpenMP include or lib files, for example:

		export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/lib"

    	export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/libomp/include"

    	cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="$LDFLAGS $CPPFLAGS" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ ..

(please change the path to the installed location of your OpenMP library)
    
### Compiling under Windows



* Please first install TDM-GCC (a GCC version for Windows) from <http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net>.

* Then install Clang for Windows from <http://clang.llvm.org>.

>**WARNING**: Although IQ-TREE can also be built with TDM-GCC, the executable does not run properly due to stack alignment issue and the `libgomp` library causes downgraded performance for the OpenMP version. Thus, it is recommended to compile IQ-TREE with Clang. 

1. Open Command Prompt. 
2. Change to the source code folder:

        cd PATH_TO_EXTRACTED_SOURCE_CODE

    Please note that Windows uses back-slash (`\`) instead of slash (`/`) as path name separator.

3. Create a subfolder, say, `build` and go into this subfolder:

        mkdir build
        cd build

4. Configure source code with CMake:

        cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=--target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=--target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=mingw32-make ..

    To build the multicore version please add `-DIQTREE_FLAGS=omp` to the cmake command. Note that the make program shipped with TDM-GCC is called `mingw32-make`, thus needed to specify like above. You can also copy `mingw32-make` to `make` to simplify this step.

5. Compile source code with:

        mingw32-make
        
    or
    
        mingw32-make -j4
        
    to use 4 cores for compilation instead of only 1.


### Compiling 32-bit version


>**NOTE**: Typically a 64-bit IQ-TREE version is built and recommended! The 32-bit version has several restriction like maximal RAM usage of 2GB and no AVX support, thus not suitable to analyze large data sets.

To compile the 32-bit version instead, simply add `m32` into `IQTREE_FLAGS` of the cmake command:

    cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=m32 .. 
    
To build the 32-bit multicore version, run: 

    cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=omp-m32 ..

For Windows you need to change Clang target with:

    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=--target=i686-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=--target=i686-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=mingw32-make ..


### Compiling MPI version


**Requirements**:

* Download source code of IQ-TREE version 1.5.1 or later. 
* Install an MPI library (e.g., [OpenMPI](http://open-mpi.org/)) if not available in your system. For Mac OS X, the easiest is to install [Homebrew package manager](http://brew.sh), and then install OpenMPI library from the command line with:

        brew install openmpi

Then simply run `CMake` and `make` by:

    cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=mpi ..
    make -j4

IQ-TREE will automatically detect and setup the MPI paths and library. Alternatively, you can also use the MPI C/C++ compiler wrappers (typically named `mpicc` and `mpicxx`), for example:

    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=mpicc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=mpicxx ..
    make -j4

The executable is named `iqtree-mpi`. One can then run `mpirun` to start the MPI version with e.g. 2 processes:

    mpirun -np 2 iqtree-mpi -s alignment ...

If you want to compile the hybrid MPI/OpenMP version, simply run:

    cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=omp-mpi ..
    make -j4

The resulting executable is then named `iqtree-mpi` (`iqtree-omp-mpi` for IQ-TREE versions <= 1.5.X). This can be used to start an MPI run with e.g. 4 processes and 2 cores each (i.e., a total of 8 cores will be used):

    # For IQ-TREE version <= 1.5.X
    mpirun -np 4 iqtree-omp-mpi -nt 2 -s alignment ...

    # For IQ-TREE version >= 1.6.0
    mpirun -np 4 iqtree-mpi -nt 2 -s alignment ...



>**NOTE**: Please be aware that [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) and [OpenMPI](http://open-mpi.org/) are different! OpenMP is the standard to implement shared-memory multithreading program, that we use to provide the multicore IQ-TREE version. Whereas OpenMPI is a message passing interface (MPI) library for distributed memory parallel system, that is used to compile `iqtree-mpi`. Thus, **one cannot run `iqtree` with `mpirun`!**


### Compiling Xeon Phi Knights Landing version


Starting with version 1.6, IQ-TREE supports Xeon Phi Knights Landing (AVX-512 instruction set). To build this version the following requirements must be met:

* A C++ compiler, which supports AVX-512 instruction set: GCC 5.1, Clang 3.7, or Intel compiler 14.0.

The compilation steps are the same except that you need to add `-DIQTREE_FLAGS=KNL` to the cmake command:  

    cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=KNL ..
    make -j4

The compiled `iqtree` binary will automatically choose the proper computational kernel for the running computer. Thus, it works as normal and will speed up on Knights Landing CPUs. Run `./iqtree` to make sure that the binary was compiled correctly: 

    IQ-TREE multicore Xeon Phi KNL version 1.6.beta for Linux 64-bit built May  7 2017
    

### Compiling IQ-TREE2 lib file


Starting with version 2.3.3, you can compile and create IQ-TREE2 lib file.

If you want to compile the IQ-TREE2 lib file, simply run:

    cmake -DBUILD_LIB=ON ..
    make -j4


<!--
Compling with deep learning kernel for ModelFinder 2
--------------------------------------------------

IQ-TREE version 2.2.x supports deep learning to speed up ModelFinder 2.
To compile you will need to install the [onnxruntime library](https://onnxruntime.ai). On a MacOS, the fastest way is via homebrew package manager:

	brew install onnxruntime
	
This will install the necessary header files in

	/usr/local/Cellar/onnxruntime/1.11.0/include/onnxruntime/core/session/

and the library file in:

	/usr/local/Cellar//onnxruntime/1.11.0/lib/
	
where 1.11.0 is the version of onnxruntime at the time of writing this document. You may need the version number which can be found by:

	brew info onnxruntime

Now you will need to run cmake by additional options:

	cmake -Donnxruntime_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/local/Cellar//onnxruntime/1.11.0/include/onnxruntime/core/session/ -Donnxruntime_LIBRARIES=/usr/local/Cellar//onnxruntime/1.11.0/lib/libonnxruntime.dylib ..
-->

### About precompiled binaries


To provide the pre-compiled IQ-TREE binaries at <http://www.iqtree.org>, we used Clang 3.9.0 for Windows and Clang 4.0 for Linux and macOS. We recommend to use Clang instead of GCC as Clang-compiled binaries run about 5-10% faster than GCC-compiled ones.

Linux binaries were statically compiled with Ubuntu 16.4 using [libc++ library](https://libcxx.llvm.org). The static-linked binaries will thus run on most Linux distributions. The CMake command is (assuming that clang-4 and clang++-4 point to the installed Clang):

    # 64-bit version
    cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=static-libcxx -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-4 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-4 <source_dir>

    # 32-bit version
    cmake -DIQTREE_FLAGS=static-m32 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-4 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-4 <source_dir>
    
macOS binaries were compiled under macOS Sierra, but the binaries are backward compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion:

    cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-4 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-4 <source_dir>

Windows binaries were statically compiled under Windows 7 using Clang 3.9.0 in combination with [TDM-GCC 5.1.0](http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net), which provides the neccessary libraries for Clang. 

    # 64-bit version
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DIQTREE_FLAGS=static -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=--target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=--target=x86_64-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=mingw32-make ..
    
    #32-bit version
    cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DIQTREE_FLAGS=static -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=--target=i686-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=--target=i686-pc-windows-gnu -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM=mingw32-make ..



### Setup an Xcode project in MacOS


Many developers in MacOS use Xcode to develop the code. To generate an XCode project for IQ-TREE, you need to run:

    mkdir build-xcode
    cd build-xcode
    cmake -G Xcode <IQTREE_SOURCE_DIR>

This will generate a a subfolder `build-xcode/iqtree.xcodeproj`, which you can open in Xcode now.
